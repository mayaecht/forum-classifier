and cleaned it out and had a shop re-weld the seams due to a leak. That was a pain, especially since it had about 45 gallons of fuel in it and an anti syphon device so couldn't syphon it out.

So I drilled a couple of holes in the bottom of the tray to drain away any water, raised the circuit board about 3/8 of an inch by putting plastic spacers between the bottom of the tray and the circuit board and siliconed the rivets to ensure water was not getting in through them.

"Our 1989 Rexhall Airex has been a good learning machine. Lots of big and little repairs.
It ran well when we bought it but last year it started backfiring when you took your foot off the gas, and using twice as much gas. Ran awful so we parked it. Local mechanics took my money for tuneups but no improvement. Its a Ford 460
fuel injected engine so I went on the Ford 460
forum for a few months. Finally got an old guy who knew the engine. He said to replace the fuel pressure regulator
and idle control valve

It has a Ford chassis and we had the famous ignition key linkage break in the steering column
. This is identified when you go to start the engine, feel a snap when you turn the key, and the key now rotates completely around with no resistence. This requires pulling the steering wheel and tearing the column apart. Lots of tricks. This is common with Fords of this era so fotunately there are lots of excellent you tube videos.

Lots of little foibles to fix. The unit has 3 sets of batteries, 2 12v chassis, 2 12v house, and 4 6v house for the inverter stuff like a residential fridge. Dealer said the 4 6v ones were bad and was replacing them for us but didn't have any 6v on hand so put in 4 12v ones wired appropriately. Turns out those were not the house batteries that were bad. Moved 2 of them to the main house area to replace the 2 bad 12v ones there and buying 4 new 6v for the front this week like it should have. At least now the main house 12v works and I can operate lites and other stuff in it.
Door check strap was not working properly so I have that all apart trying to fabricate a fix for it.

I have a ""water in fuel"" warning about 100 miles from the dealer driving it home, but there is no water coming out of the separator so I think either the sensor or filter in it may be bad.
While under the front dealing with batteries I noticed the inside of both front wheels are ""wet"" so I will be doing inner wheel bearing

Congrats on your TourMaster coach. We had several in our Club and they had Mercedes engines which were very good and powerful engines. It seems like most of the stuff you have to fix are regular maintenance on any motor home
. Like the anodes, they need to be changed out every year. Fact I just done mine on a Suburban ten gallon tank. Got the part through Amazon for thirteen bucks (magnesium) type.
The painting of the cabinets is what is hard for me to imagine why so soon. I have the Walnut wood on mine and we just love it.
The battery thing is also hard to figure out why the dealer would replace six volt batteries with twelve volt batteries. It will work if hooked up properly, but the thing is that deep cycle six volt batteries are much better for the house part. Twelve volt for the chassis, cranking of the engine is just fine.
Best of luck with your new coach.",Chassis

I know exactly what you are going thru as our last coach was a 2006 Georgie Boy Pursuit. The first day when were got home with our new to us MH the front driver side slide wouldn't go in, motor worked but no slide movement. Looking under the slide to see what was going on i saw other pieces of broken shear pins of various types. I used a bolt for the temporary fix. Thought okay this is probably why i got such a good deal as the previos owner wasn't as handy.
One of the broken pins looked like a roll pin which i couldnt find in any stores so i got a 1/4"" SS clevis pin. I bought several just in case. That broke again some time later. The second pin i put in i removed after the 6th use to see whats going on and it was bent and would soon break. I took a 1/4 drill bit to clean up where the pin went, put a new one in without having to use a hammer and punch and at the 6th slide use i just pushed the old one out with the new one. Only took a few minutes. I was concerned what would happen if the pin would break when the slide was almost in, that would be a very difficult repair.
It didn't take long to use up my supply of pins and started a search. I found a manufacture of quality SS pins at pivotpins.com. Only catch was their $35 minium order. I had a supply to last a lifetime. The 1/4 pins i bought had the small hole in the end where i put a cotter pin in so it wouldnt fall out. When we traded in that GB all i could pass along to the potential owner was the pins i had in the coach. Somewhere in my garage i will eventually find that bag of pins.
Over the 5 years of owning the GB every time we met another GB owner they would ask if i had a problem with the slide. I would say yes and tell them my work around. This was most likely an under engineered design subject to fail.",Electrical

"While on my trip (Seattle to HB, Ca.) I had a trans slip issue start up while on the last leg of the pass just south of Ashland, Oregon. After cresting the RV would not go beyond 30-35mph. Pull off at Yreka, Ca. stayed the night (Baxters Auto lot).
The next morning they sent me over to Onarheim truck repair. Mechanic checked what I had checked (fluid) which was perfect no issue. he also drove it without issue. Says it may have gotten hot.
Continue on south. Made it to HB, Ca. (shot over from the 5 to the 101 via 505 - 680 - 101). No issue.
On the return trip ~10 days later just south of Willits, Ca. (after a pass) I had it do the same thing again. This was after driving without issue from just north of San Louis Obisbo.
Same results next morning no issue. However roughly 35 later same issue popped up. This time I could tell the trans was in limp mode. Not going from 2-3. Quickly realizing that when turning of the engine and restarting it resets and all is ok. Now beginning to look like shift solenoid issue. Did this (3) until I reached Grants Pass, Oregon and stopped the night. Ended up staying just outside of Jerry's Clutch & Transmission (Great guy). While stopped I used paper clip to pull codes 68 and 87.
The following morning (Joe) mechanic used computer and pulled same codes:
68 - Trans slip
87 - Shift solenoid stuck open
He quickly fixed it by stating the 68 slip can be resolved by turning the force valve up 1/4 turn and we'll replace both shift solenoids A & B.
While we had the RV up on rack he also found that the trans wire connector was leaking as well. Replaced it with upgraded one. Back on the road in roughly 2-3 hours. $290

I see, so no eternabond around the perimeter of the vent, correct?
I have a Thread linked below where I asked about this. Seems that many do Dicor, wait 24 hours then EternaBond tape around the vents but I'm not sure how they handled the vent hinge (front side of vent)...

I'm going to take more of the old Dicor off and clean then apply new Dicor today or tomorrow. Have the EternaBond tape and roller here but confused on the vent hinge.
I replaced a few of the rusty head screws with new SS #8 1"". Have one screw that doesn't want to seat all the way so probably will use a #8 3/4"" in that hole. Probably didn't need to replace them and maybe it wasn't wise.

I'm not familiar with your model coach but my coach is on a Gillig chassis and I bought the replacement switch assembly from Gillig. The part is made from a nylon plastic which I believe is true for all makes and model vehicles. The tab which returns the turn signal
lever to the neutral position after completing a left turn had broken and I would have to manually return the lever to the middle (off) position.
If you have a switch to turn off your air horns then turn them off first. The, remove the horn button
to expose the steering wheel bolts and the large center nut. My steering wheel is mounted with three allen head bolts. After removal of the steering wheel I removed the center nut which holds a backing plate in place. You will then need a steering wheel/hub pulling tool and three of the same thread sized bolts as the allen head bolts but longer. The tool can probably be bought at any auto parts
store and may, or may not, come with the bolts you will need. Before removing the hub use a Sharpie or similar to mark the position relative to the steering shaft so that your steering will be reinstalled in the same position at reassembly. You will then have access to the switch assembly. Disconnect and remove the assembly. The wires go down along the column. If your wires don't have a plug you have to cut and splice the new wires into place. if your coach doesn't already have a switch to turn off the air horns then this is a good opportunity to install one. Mine did not have a switch and more than once the horn was blown at a less than ideal time. (I blame my kids.) put everything back together and you should be good to go.

Who puts maint. free batteries in an RV?? I put an ounce of mineral oil in each cell of the new batteries to help prevent gassing off, it works! Then I changed oil and filter (full synthetic Amsoil) changed fuel filter
and installed shut off valves on the inlet and outlet side to make changing the fuel filter
easier in the future. Serviced the trans, new filters and Amsoil full synthetic as well. Changed rear end oil to you guessed it Amsoil 75-90 severe gear full synthetic, changed the oil in my front wheel bearings
to the Amsoil synthetic as well, then greased ""Everything"" with Amsoil grease. (can you tell I love Amsoil products? my buddy is an Amsoil dealer) I had both rear inner dual tire valve stems replaced because when I put the Eeze TPMS system on I had issues with leaks. Replaced my coach water pump with a better higher flow pump and it works awesome! I also had to install anti billowing devices on my kitchen / living room slide and bed room slide as we were coming back form Saskatchewan in strong cross winds and it parachuted my kitchen slide topper out, had to crawl up on the roof and clamp some vice grips on it to stop it. Then the fun stuff, the outside was looking shabby so I had to repaint some of the stripes as the stripes are painted over a gel coat finish, not full paint. The stealership where we bought it in Arizona tried to buff the road side to make it shine but all they did was cut down the clear coat over the stripes so now they are pealing. Then scrubbed the whole unit down and put about 10 coats of ZEP on it, I know a lot of people on here don't like ZEP but up here in Canada we don't have the intense sun like the southern states so it work just fine up here, I still plan on putting a good UV protecting wax on top of it to help protect it and then give it a few coats of ZEP every spring to stay ahead of it. for a 2004 coach it looks like new!

Mikonos,
Partner, this is not the thread for this but, I gotta tell ya Pal, from that second picture, it looks dangerously close to the point that your rear wheels/tires are very close to ALMOST no-contact with the ground. And, it's a down hill slope to the rear. If I had to guess, I'd say your coach was still not level even though you had your rear jacks extended quite a bit. At least that's the way I see things in that picture. However, pictures can be deceiving.
Bud, just for info and you and your significant other's safety here, I'd pack a couple of ramps, some blocks etc. so that in a condition like what I see there, you could drive up on to assist in leveling so that your jacks aren't over extended to get you to level.

I donâ€™t mean to disagree with you but calcium buildup can and will lead to element failure. The calcium will cause corrosion to form between the metal casing around the heating element allowing pinholes to form. Water then gets into the insulator and grounds the element. After the element shorts inside the water heater it will cause the amperage to increase to the point it burns the wire terminals
. Calcium buildup can also damage the element by acting as an insulation around the outside of the element. This results in damage to the element and again my result in failure.",Heating & Cooling

And you probably saved yourself a $400 repair bill from the local Ford Dealership who would have replaced the clock spring and all the cruise related switches in the cab, then told you that in addition to the switches which they already replaced being bad, the brake fluid pressure switch was ALSO bad, so another $225.00 to replace the $42.00 part. They would have said that until they had replaced all the switches (which weren't even bad, but they don't know how to troubleshoot) they couldn't have known that the brake fluid pressure switch was bad . . . Or something like that . . .",Chassis

All of the warning lights would suddenly come on and the coach would die. Now this is not good especially if you were on the interstate at 65 mph. The other warning that came on was a transmission communication error and the coach would die. Five visits and multiple phone calls to the local and South Carolina manufacturing site for Freightliner they finally figured out the Europe codes, the shift pad was shorting out and causing the coach to lose communication with the transmission and for some unknown reason kill the engine. So if you have a Palazzo and these issues come to light have them check the shift pad first and you might be able to avoid 8 months of not using your coach vs the fun of using it!

They aren't/weren't mangled... except the one that went through 3 drill bits
and didn't even make a dent. There wasn't enough grip in the head to keep the bit locked in. I used to have some bits with teeth on them. Cant find them to save my life.

Hey Tim,
Well, at present, I think I have no less than about 20+ pairs of pliers in my tool box. 5-6 pairs of vise grips (some are burnt from holding close proximity joints for welding), some small (about 4"" long needle nosed vice trips and blunt nosed ones too), gas or regular pliers, BIG BERTHA or, otherwise known as the largest pair of channel lock type pliers made by Craftsman, cutters of all types and sizes, wire strippers of all types and sizes and specialty pliers for specific purposes. I've used vice grips for all my life. Yep, they have their place in the mechanical world but, usually not the first in line up of what to use.
As for penetrating oil, well, 65 now and, been been wrenching ever since I was oh, probably around 12 or so and, as of yet, I've NEVER, EVER had a penetrating oil work for me. I've tried pretty much everyone that's been made. I've soaked things for 3-4 days and, no luck. Some folks have had luck with penetrating oils but, not me. The most recent case for me was the infamous fan hub bearing replacement for our C-7 330 CAT. CAT, in it's infinite wisdom, decided that four, Allen head, flat head, metric 6MM or 7mm screws would hold the fan serpentine pulley onto the fan hub. Well, in order to get that fan hub off, you have to get those Allen head screws out.
Well, after quite a bit of time screwing around with every method known to man, trying to break them free, I said the hell with it and, hit them with something stronger than they were. A DRILL BIT! That did the trick. I had all four off, and the pulley, in about 2-3 minutes. Should have done that in the first place. Live and learn.
As for cutting blades for sawzalls etc., I've been using ""Lennox"" blades from Lowes. They are white in color and, without a doubt, some of the strongest blades and, long lasting blades, I've seen yet. I've used some that I should have worn out long before they did. A tad costly but, well worth it if you tackle harder jobs now and then.

I assume you mean the washer.
Turns out it didn't need a pump anyway. In being removed from it's hole for the re-plumbing project(long story short, the coach froze and busted all the plumbing when my electric heater in the basement failed)the drain hose got pulled off the pump just enough to leak a bit. Re-positioned the hose and clamp and I think it's good.
Access required laying it on it's side and taking the bottom off. While it was out I had a drip tray fabricated so if it does leak again it won't get into the walls. Just about done with the trial load and not a drip of water in the pan.

What you've overlooked is the fact that the replacement cooling unit is an upgraded Arctic Air, (aka Amish) unit that is not under recall and has not caused any fires, not a Norcold replacement. The extinguisher is only for safety redundancy, if something highly unlikely should occur.

Mine sure was too. The reason the bearings were bad on my unit was because when they were pressed on the commutator shaft, the press pushed against the bearing race dust cover instead of against the inner ring of the bearing. I could see the square indents marked on the dust cover. These bearings are quite tight on the shaft and need to be pressed on carefully. If you don't have a press, and the right puller to pull them off, I'm sure a local machine shop could do the job in about 5 minutes.",Electrical

"On the way home from the southwest this spring, my Winegard Trav'ler antenna would not retract completely to the stow position. After trying repeated re-calibrations, I had to use the manual retract system. A call to Winegard got an obnoxious technician who would only recite a canned script that said I had an out of date system that was out of production. When I asked if parts were available, she refused to answer and would only read the script. The bottom line was that I was to get the unit down from the roof, pay postage to send it to Winegard and then they would tell me if they even had parts to repair it. I had already disassembled it enough to know the elevation motor was the problem. That was the last straw with Winegard.
After a post on a few RV forums, I was directed to RF Mogul. A couple of calls got me the a WEB site and I ordered one.

"I've been busy the last few weeks.
Had a bad air leak. Traced it to the right rear air bag. Oxidation of the rubber had allowed chips of rubber to break loose where the bag has sharp bends in it. Records indicate that the bags are original, so nearly 20 years. Replaced both rear bags. Not a terrible job, but requires heavy duty jackstands to make sure you don't get crushed. The fronts are just as chipped, but aren't leaking. Yet. No leaks in the system now.
The chassis AC was inop when I bought it, so I got after it. I didn't want to put a bunch of freon in it just to diagnose any leaks, so I decided to shotgun the compressor, receiver/drier, and expansion valve
. Judging by the compressor and idler pulleys, it looks like the compressor froze up and the belt melted over the pulleys. Decided to break each component apart and flush everything. That's when I found out that the evaporator/heater core box on the front wall was falling apart. The flange screws had been driven in so hard the plastic flange broke. I reinforced the flange with sheet metal, front and back, held on with marine adhesive sealant. Then put in new foam, cleaned up the fins and flushed the evaporator. The box and compressor are installed, but I haven't yet flushed the lines and condenser, but getting there.

I installed a (mostly) wireless unit, it is not particularly great, but is an improvement over the old one (better resolution, brighter display, better color accuracy, ...). This is the one I bought https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WR6ZX84/ though I bought it as an Amazon warehouse open box deal item for $50 which greatly improved the bang for the buck ratio. It does still suffer from some interference and appears to use an analog signal, where the newer units use a digital signal, though they tend to sell for $180+.
This unit also has inputs for 2 wired side view cameras, and possibly an optional forward viewing wireless camera, although I can't find a part number for it. Overall the build quaility on the camera and monitor is better than the old no name brand ones I had. Though the camera looks almost identical to the old one at a distance, it is obvious on closer inspection that the housing and mount are built much better, with thicker steel, allen head screws vs Phillips head, detents on the metal to hold in position, etc.",Electrical

Found the board sealed in resin on a 2004 model that mentioned to check for bad traces on the board. I imagine its been replaced at some point.
Interesting to see it sealed probably to protect it from the elements. I worked for Rockford Fosgate
in the 80s and they sealed their boards in resin and silica sand to hopefully prevent other companies from stealing their tech. Hadn't thought about it in forever until seeing this board jogged the memory loose. I would bet their stuff is no longer hand made in the good ole USA.
Anyway, I digress. I put it all together and flipped the switch and it did absolutely nothing. I was like hmmm. Not intermittent anymore. Waited a few minutes and nothing. Even had a shower to run the water out of the tank with the 115 element off and nothing. Not even a click of the gas valve.

Your compressor side probably was damaged long before the gasket went. It doesn't take much to do the damage it has. You will likely see a real improvement in power and economy after you replace the turbo.

Sorry for your radiator woes. We ran through a radiator problem with out 2001 Dutch Star. Radiator started leaking, limped to a Freightliner shop. They recommended NOT using the Freightliner radiator as they had a lot of problems with them. They recommended a local speed shop who built radiators from scratch, better built, better warranty, took a week to remove, take to shop, shop built radiator, reinstalled. That was three years and 25k miles ago. No issues since. Oh, and for history, the PO replaced the Freightliner radiator 5 (FIVE) times in 120k miles . . . One was road damage, installed wrong radiator and replaced it with correct one, no charge, that one was faulty radiator, failed after maybe 3 months, replaced, no charge, the other two were unexplained.

"Had trouble with my brakes keeping the air pressure up. I replaced air dryer first then the governor with no results. So I thought must be compressor so I got the top end kit. I took it apart and found a piece broken and replaced it.
Started it up and pressure went up great so I thought I had fixed it, not so quick. After about twenty miles down the road air pressure dropped without even using the air Sooo back to work.
I pulled the top of the compressor back off and everything was fineðŸ˜•. I figured out that while it was cooled off it would pump up but would not stay up. So I decided to get another governor this time I bought one from Bendix ( the mfg.) of the compressor and not an off brand. That was the problem. I was lucky because all this happened about twenty miles from home.

I believe the output wire from it is purple and goes to a 1/4"" terminal on the ESI board. Check for 12 volt there. If it's zero volt, the thermal fuse is bad.
The printing on the fuse give enough info to google it. Amazon and eBay carry them. So do most electrical supply places. So do RV stores.
This all assumes you usually try to heat your water with propane. But if the thermal fuse is bad, some ESI control boards will shut off the electric element relay too.",Heating & Cooling

Air dryer cycling issues are almost never caused by the air dryer. Every time the compressor unloads the dryer purges. Find out why the system won't hold pressure and your cycling issue will be cured.
OTOH, rebuilding the dryer can't hurt anything.
If you don't find an external leak start testing valves.",Chassis
"Many times the leaks are in the 1/4 "" lines between the dryer, governor and wet tank. If the governor is remote mounted, there is one more line to check.
The air pressure gauges don't monitor the wet tank, so the leak could be undetected while in the cab.
In a few cases, I've temporarily installed a air gauge in the drain valve port of the wet tank to check the lines for leaks.
The wet tank will be one end of the longer air tank with 2 drains. Look for the seam around it. The wet tank will be the shorter section.",Plumbing

I just went through this process. The first thing i would recommend is to air it up and listen, if you don't hear anything obvious i would look up the brake tests that should be done pre trip, it gives you a guideline as to how much pressure the system should lose doing standard tests. It will give you an idea if the brake chambers are the issue. Otherwise you need a good old bottle of soap water and start hunting. Its helpful to understand how the system works, i will not go into it here but you can find all this on the internet. there are relays front and rear that control the front and rear brakes.

I was a service manager and was lucky enough to go to the dealer show every year at Louisville. This show is not open to the public. It is for dealers only. All the representatives from the different manufacturers are there. This includes the tire manufacturers. ALL the manufacturers said there tires were good for ten years. Where does the 5 to 7 years come from? The tire dealers. They are wanting to sell more tires. I will go with the manufacturers recommendation every time. The funny thing is, according to the manufacturers, your chance of a tire failure is with a new tire. If a tire is built bad it will fail fairly soon. If it lasts several years, it was built to specs and will be good for ten years.",Chassis

"Fixed flletwood a/c control
irv2 and its contributors have been a valuable resource for people like me who own an older motor-home. In particular, I want to do a special thank you to Waiter21. Its people like him that make irv2 the valuable resource it's become.
I'm getting ready for a trip in a few weeks, but having problems with my A/C and furnace, They come on and run for no reason, and are totally unreliable. It got to the point where I was turning the circuit breakers on/off to run the units manually. I need to get this fixed before my trip
Searching through posts on irv2, this seemed to be a common problem with older Intellitec ECC control systems. Waiter21 chimed in and offered several things to get the system working, cleaning the switches and sliders, look carefully at the circuit boards for corrosion and bad solder joints especially where the connectors plugs are. He gave me his phone number and we talked on the phone. Everything looked ok, but when I tested it, there wasn't any change He suggested calling Intellitec, they may be able to repair my boards, and also check with Fleetwood, they may have some new boards in stock.
He then said he had one other option that I might be interested in. He does electronics and computers as a hobby, and had been working on a replacement for his Intellitec system. He had so much documantion that he put together a dedicated web site just for this (he does web sites as a hobby also). I wasn't expecting a lot but went there as a last resort just to see what he had done.
www.waiterecc.com
WOW - This is AWSOME
After talking to Intellitec and Fleetwood, I called Waiter21 about what it would take to get one of his systems. (his real name is John) He said he doesn't offer these for sale because he's still tweaking on it, and the market is so small its probably not a viable commercial product. He said he'd let me have one at cost, but I needed to review all the installation, operation, and technical stuff on the web site, install and operate it, then report back any problems or suggestions for improvement. He called it BETA testing.
He sent me a system, circuit board, operator panel, temperature sensor, and some custom wire bundles. It took about 2 hours to install everything. When I turned it on, IT WORKED.. I followed his recommendation to do a calibration of the original temperature sensors, they were within 1 degree.
As I operated the system over the next few days, I had two questions for him. The AUTO COOL seemed to operate a little differently than the original Intellitec. (I like the new way). He said several others had suggested changeing how the blower operates in AUTO. Everyone likes the new process, when A/C reches the set point, blower turns off about 30 seconds after the compressor turns off.
The other big one for me was the temperature display. I live in Canada and we do things the correct way, in Celsius. When I called him, he said â€œDARN, I never even thought of thatâ€. That afternoon, he calls me back and says to check my email. He had made a change to the software so you can configure it to either display in F or C. He then walked me through how to upload this change to my system.
This whole experience has been absolute awesome, If it hadn't been for irv2 and Waiter21, I probably would have spent a thousand dollars to fix the old system. Instead, I now have a modern system that has all kinds of neat features, at a small fraction of the cost. Again, Thank you Waiter21, you have some really neat hobbies.
If you're having problems with your Intellitec system, and it looks like its not repairable, take a look at what Waiter21 has put together. Visit his web site and check out his system. Contact him and see what it would take to get one of these for you motor-home. www.waiterecc.com",Heating & Cooling
"Well gang,
I noticed a few drops of pink type fluid on my RV garage floor so I got under it to check out just what it was. It could have been tranny fluid or coolant. It was coolant. A loose radiator hose
clamp for a radiator lower hose was that culprit. But, while under there I noticed the water pump belt was quite loose on our CAT C-7 330HP. Well it was a major operation to do what was needed to be done. I had to yank the radiator, air intake
tube, and slide out the basement A/C 3/4 of the way.
All of that was needed to gain access to the fastening bolts/screws etc. that retain the radiator and CAC in our '04 Itasca Horizon 36GD. I had to yank the radiator simply because, I could not get to ONE BOLT that is used to secure the water pump belt tensioner so I could tighten the water pump belt. When I finally got to it, I found the tensioner was very rough in rotation so, I removed it and installed new bearings. While in there, I installed new bearings in both my serpentine belt tensioner and the serpentine belt idler.
And, might as well install some new belts while in there too. Once that was all back together, I dove into removing the S-cam rollers on my front brakes and clean and lube all that stuff up. I re-adjusted the slack adjusters, took it all out for a test drive and, no leaks in the rear of the coach, no clunk in the brake application and, all is well. Man these things are a pain in the A...
But, hopefully, I'm good for quite a while and can use it with confidence that important stuff is taken care of.

"We lost our satellite reception a year ago. Last June, our dealer replaced the receiver with a Wally and the dome antenna with a Playmaker. They could not get it to lock on to the satellite's. We needed the coach for a trip and we do not watch TV much on the road, so we let it go. They tried again in Sept before we left for the south, but still no cigar. After several attempts on my own, I finally have reception, but still confused. It turned out that both coax cables from the playmaker (Tiffin had a spare cable) would carry 13.25 volts to the antenna, but would not carry a signal back to the receiver. The HDMI powered splitter was also bad. I finally have a perfect picture with sound by running an external coax from antenna through the gap of a bedroom slide into the receiver and using the powered HDMI splitter that was intended for Traveler Sat antenna which we do not have. I am at a a loss as to how or why both OEM coax cables and the HDMI splitter could be bad. I tried eliminating different combinations of each component, but could not single out just one of them. Now, the simplest permanent solution is to run the new coax down next to the middle AC unit

"Well, yesterday when attempting to replace my air pressure spin on filter, it wouldn't budge using my strap wrench.

All it takes is a little slack on this stuff instead of stretching everything so tight. Not blaming it on engineers with bean counters following them around, however.
Anyway, my filter wrench
easily slipped over it now and for easily coming loose.
By the way and for those doing so, don't forget to bleed all the air out or you might not ever break it free. Mine has an air valve on the line next to it, but you may have to bleed the tanks with the lanyards' or for crawling down under to do so.",Chassis
"Sounds like I am not the only one with cable issues. We have not been able to get cable to work at any RV parks, but have only been to about 7 or so since we bought our '21 Cornerstone. Since the dealer, MHSRV in Texas, said they couldn't do it for a couple of weeks when we BOUGHT the coach, we figured we would wait and take care of it later. Well, later has arrived. I contacted DISH and DTV, and since we don't have either one at our home, the quote is $177 a month for MOST of the channels we actually want. Hmmm, for part timers, not sure that sounds quite right. Then I meet a nice couple in Naples that said they plug in a device like an Apple TV box, and they are tied to their home account and it doesn't cost them anything. ?? I call Apple, as we have multiple Apple boxes at home, and they said they don't know anything about RV's. I call the closest Entegra dealer, and they say to order the receiver and set up the plan we want, then bring it to them and they will sort it out for me. I just can't quite seem to get my arms around the simple facts. I have a Winegard satellite on the roof already, so it should be simple, but beyond my expertise. And no one I have talked with knows how to get in motion satellite/wi-fi, so I am hoping the dealer can do it.
The only thing I fixed my myself lately is my drawer under the entry steps that would keep popping open on all my LH turns. Dealer said they fixed it, but on the first corner leaving the dealership, the drawer slammed into the entry door again. So when I got home, I figured out how to remove the drawer, then discovered there was a screw missing inside that held the back of the drawer in position with a magnet holding the drawer shut. After shimming up with an additional magnet, the problem was solved.

"Departing Gulf Shores, Alabama, last week I heard a flapping noise under the engine cover. I removed the cover and found the engine serpentine belt was disintegrating . The spare belt was folded tightly and didn't want to spread out to fit the many pulleys so after several unsuccessful attempts I ended up using tape to hold it on the alternator and A/C compressor pulleys while I crawled underneath to connect everything else. The Chevy 8.1 engine has the belt tensioner underneath, and a 3/8 breaker bar
is used to rotate it to release the belt tension. It's very handy to have a small ratchet strap to hold the breaker bar
in position while attaching the serpentine belt. Also, a pair of needle nose pliers
to remove remains of the belt that had wrapped around the fan hub. The good news is that I caught this in time to pull into a shopping center for replacement rather than having a complete failure on the interstate highway",Heating & Cooling

Next will be the furnace. It was working good, then all of a sudden it would run the fan for a few minutes then it would turn off, not igniting. So I have to find out what is causing it not to ignite. Never worked on a furnace S-42 Suburban before, so it is going to be a challenge for me. Good thing my coach was equipped with two heat pumps that worked pretty good, but going to Yosemite it might get real cold. LOL!
when my furnace did that, it turned out that the propane regulator
was bad. If your stove won't support more than one burner and the flame has a lot of orange/yellow, it may be the regulator.",Heating & Cooling

That would have been allot more work to run coax and glad i didn't have to.
Today i undertook putting an 110v outlet in that cabinet. Why Thor didn't my guess would be to save a few pennies. They did at least have the cabinet cutout covered up with material so all i needed for that part was to cut an X in the material. Had to remove the A pillar plastic cover and fish tape down to another 110v supply. Getting to that one zip tie on a bundle of wires to cut proved most challenging.

"Well,
For those of you that may need replacement mud flaps
, the ones behind the duals, not the long-full length one, I just did it today. For the life of me, I could not find them in the Winne parts catalog. So, I called a few auto parts
stores in my area. Napa was the winner here. They had several different flaps I could choose from.
I ended up choosing the cheapest ones they had. They are good quality rubber and are, 24"" x 24"" and don't have any logo or name on them. They are about 1/4"" thick with some ribbing here and there for structural strength.
But, my flaps ( maybe as well as many of yours out there in RV land) are only 23.5"" wide by 12"" long. So, I could have purchased one single flap and cut two out of it. But, based on the design of them, I would have ended up with one that had rounded corners at the bottom and one with square corners, not good.
So, for a measly $26 for the two of them total, I got two. I cut the bottom half to be used for the flaps. The reason I used the bottom half is because the corners were already rounded. I had gasket hole punches from Harbor Freight already so, punching those holes in that rubber, was a piece of cake.
It's all done and, they look great. So, if anyone has some sad looking mud flaps
or, they're completely gone or aged, check your local Napa store.",Exterior

My water heater was completely loaded with calcium buildup but the wiring was unaffected so I'm not sure if that could cause the wires to get hot. I also spent several hours cleaning out the deposits which were caked to the tank lining below the heating element.

The most recent repair was installing a new water tank/city water diversion valve in the water compartment.
And that caused me to have to drain the water tank so I wouldn't keep getting rained on while in there for repairs. Well, when I went to fill the tank, drip, drip, drip, etc. at a fairly rapid pace, from the bottom of the coach. CRAP, now what? Well, it turned out to be the water tank drain valve. Since it had never been used, when I used it to drain the water, it apparently developed a bad seal. So, I had to dive into that one. $12.00 later and, about 2 hours labor, all done, new valve.

I think IF I were to change out my cooling unit, I would use one of the helium units that is available. No chance of fire that way. But, in reality, if mine goes out, I'm changing over to residential. I'm tired of screwing around with the Norcold.

Hi Rick, I was afraid to use anything like 600, or 1000. Probably took me longer to achieve the results I got.

Don't know if you got it fixed but the problem is likely to be melted actuators. They are car door lock actuators
. They have a plastic case. If the relay that supplies 12vdc sticks, 12vdc is applied continuously. This causes the actuator
to overheat and the housing melts .... then the actuator is stuck. Typically multiple actuators will get stuck at the same time. Try every door ... you may find 1 you can unlock with the key. This is NOT a good problem to have. If you can get 1 hatch open you may be able to get into the other bays by crawling thru. Fixing the problem depends on the RV make/model/yr..

The Ford's is easily cleanable with special MAF cleaner (don't use carb cleaner).
So, it's worth doing just to do. You need ""special"" security Torx bit (the one with the pin in the middle of the ""star"") to remove the MAF.

Now, to be fair to the tech - he could have been right.
DexCool is an OAT style coolant, and it doesn't mix well with others - including some of the newer OAT (purple) formulations. If it inadvertently gets mixed with the standard glycol coolants with silica aditives you will have a mess that resembles mud. It will form globules that tend to block smaller passages. DexCool is an OAT coolant. I would never mix one of the ""Universal"" coolants with it. Those that are advertised as ""universal"" do not meet all of the DexCool specifications. You can buy DexCool compliant coolants from Prestone and Zerex. Even Peak branded coolant, which really pushes their ""universal"" coolant offers a DexCool specific product. For those of us with HOAT coolants in our vehicles, it looks like the Zerex G05 is the only coolant meeting all of those specifications. Like before, you don't want to mix OAT and HOAT coolants. Anyone adding a universal coolant to an HOAT system will be introducing additive packages that will break down the original fill and cause problems.
I have worked on vehicles that have had issues from the wrong coolant being added. Gone are the days of just grabbing a jug of the green stuff and filling your vehicle radiator. Of course, also gone are the days of annual coolant flushes and refills.....
I am always very careful when it comes to adding coolant to a vehicle. I check the owner's manual to ensure that the proper type is used. The same goes for automatic transmission fluid

Well I had the truck for 6 more years and never had a problem. It's an universal coolant meaning it can be used in any cooling system. Sure, don't mix specific kinds as that will not work out.

I don't know about others, but I would certainly agree. I lost a perfectly good battery years ago by having a failed battery in the circuit and overcharging the good one. Perhaps there are gadgets to keep that from happening now, I don't know.
My reference to ""jumping"" the chassis batt. to coach batts. was a means of using the generator to replace a failed alternator to charge the chassis batt. The Cummins engine
seemed perfectly happy with a lack of electrical power, but not so the 3060 Allison. We were ""dead in the water"" until we jumped the batts. and run the gen the remaining 800 miles home.

The original problem I was having was due to voltage drop at the ignition lead to the isolation delay relay, the blue wire on the relay needs to see 13.3 v for 12 sec before it closes the tombreta relay tying the chassis and house batteries together which allows the alternator to charge the house batteries. Due to drop on the ignition lead that is connected to the blue wire on the isolation relay the voltage never got above 12.9 v which would never allow the batteries to charge so I used the voltage at the chassis battery post in the front distribution panel and switched it on using a relay powered by the ignition lead , I drew a sketch that I am attaching the drawing does not show it but I added a 5 amp fuse in the chassis battery lead before the relay contact if you have any questions let me know.",Electrical

If HWH their website is very helpful as are their tech reps via phone. Springs are pretty reasonable $ and not hard to do if you have a safe way to get clearance under the rig.
Wooden wedges placed between coils of an extended spring and retract the cylinder is a helpful trick for removal.
Reverse for replacement... clamp one end hook in a vise and insert wedges as you bend the other end from side to side extending the spring. Install on a fully retracted cylinder and then e tend to remove wedges.

If it's a roller shade, there's a slim chance it's repairable. Over the years at our shop, I tried to repair them many, many, times. The first challenge is being able to access the spring assembly. On both metal and wood rollers, there's usually a small brad or rivet securing the end. These will have to be removed before you try to pry the end cap off to access the spring. The other end is just a cap with a pivot and doesn't need to be removed. Beware, if the spring is still wound, there can be considerable tension on it. Wear eye protection. The vast majority of the time when the spring pressure goes it's because the spring itself has broken. If the break is near one end, you can sometimes remove the short broken piece and re-anchor the end, then re-tension, and reinstall. Did you hear anything let go when you tried to raise it? If not, it might be the dogging mechanism is jammed. Repairs to this are also rare because of this is where all the wear takes place and the hole can get elongated or worn or the dogging cam shaft worn. However the most common symptom of a failing dog, is the shade won't stay down. Usually when we got a work order to repair a roller shade or projector screen
, I'd suggest it be replaced because being able to make an effective repair is so unlikely. Now, of course, if this was my shade, I'd be taking it down to look just because I always like to see if I could fix it. But that's me.",Chassis

I have no idea how to size this when shopping for blades. Google searches are vague at best. These forums mention blades for lot of different coach builders, which use different sizes. I ordered Trico 67-324 from Amazon (because they state they are for RV's) and the hook is sloppy on the blade mount; the width of the slot on the blade is much larger than the arm hook and there is too much play on the inside (10.5mm) hook clearance. There are no adapters included with these blades.

The Winnebago manual has no mention of wipers. I called Winnebago Customer Care, and they told me they have no idea what size the wiper arms accept, but I could buy replacements by calling Mobility RV. I do not want replacements; the beam type blades do not make good contact with the windshield at the tips.

I can’t give you a specific measurement but there two size J hooks. You apparently got a wide blade J hook and have a narrow J hook on the wiper arm.,Wiper Parts
"While I can't answer your specific question, I believe MH mfgs frequently change the type of wipers depending on what's available/price etc when they are building them. I have not replaced the wipers on my Precept yet, but on my previous MH that had the 32"" long blades, I changed to 28"" long which reduced the ""drag"" and ""skipping"" quite a bit. I had read on the forums that many had done that and were happy with the results. The 28"" length cleans plenty of area for adequate vision. Here is a link to another thread and I'm sure there are others if you do a search.",Wiper Parts
"I just checked the arm J -hook using a blade off of my Ford Expedition. The width appears correct (9mm?) but the fit is no good because there is too much slop inside the hook. So there must be more to it than just a 12mm and 9mm fit. So even going to 28 inch long blades, which are commonly available, does not solve the J-hook fit issue. Very annoying.",Wiper Parts
"The blade length is the thing that really matters when shopping for blades. Any set of blades I have bought in the last 30 years comes with adapters to fit the different sizes and styles of clips. For our Vista we just buy 32"" Trico blades on Amazon.",Wiper Parts
The adapter would be the most important thing for you. That said I bought 28” Rain X and I am happy with them. The two inch difference at the top and bottom made no difference in my sight line and I found the less surface area was cleaning better on the highway.,Wiper Parts

Although I order most everything from Amazon, wiper blades are common enough to pick up locally wherever we happen to be, at least that is what we have experienced over several decades and dozens of vehicles, hope you find a set of wipers for your rig that fits your wiper arm properly.",Wiper Parts

We do have a single piece windshield with slight sweeping curves. Vs two piece that can at times be primarily flat.

As our pair are still serviceable, wanted to do a deeper dive and ask for input from the collective Class A owner's on wiper blades that they feel are superior.

I can always order the AM replacement blades, if they feedback is that it really does not matter!!

"LOL! I went with the Tricor 67-284's.

The box shows a pass thru rivet for the plastic part that connects to J-Hooks. And, it shows a second hole, with the box direction showing the bolt attachment like I have on our coach. BUT NO HOLE for the bolt, on the actual wiper!

Sure, if I was home I could drill a hole. Or more likely pop-out the pass thru rivet and use those holes.

At first I thought Tricor had missed the drilling the hole, THAT THEY SHOW the picture of with the bolt/nut attachment. So opened the second box, and same thing...

I do carry tools, and I do have a Dremel on board. But, drilling and grinding off a rivet - will certainly mar/scratch the paint. And yes, I can go buy a can of spray paint and touch that up...

But you know, it just does not seem right! As we have rain to contend with, and one of the passenger wipers blade is now falling a part - I moved the rubber insert from Tricor to the AM wiper... But want the new wiper bow, as they're new, and the I believe they will keep the rubber blade in better contact with the windshield.

Just the entire wiper assembly, in packs of two. I understand that the stores just want the extra profit for selling something the consumer might need 'right now' if a storm is coming but often as not the wiper assy on their car/truck/RV is in excellent condition and all that is needed is the refill blade.

"Yeah, they've been using that system even on some of their passenger cars for several years now. I hear it's quite expensive so maybe just their higher-end models? ...not sure. However, because the size of a bus windshield, I'd imagine that they'd be even more expensive to equip a bus with that system.

No way would an American motorhome manufacturer include such a system on an entry level motorhomes. Maybe on the Prevost -type coaches?

From what I'm gathering, the Magic Vision Control wipers are a patented design that Mercedes first started using in 2017 on their higher-end cars. They are standard on their new Citaro bus (HERE) but, again, it's a higher-end transit bus with the latest features.

The washer system is on the blade itself but the entire wiper assembly is integrated. According to the article below, for cars, the entire assembly (blade and arm) has to be replaced if something is get broken or worn out ...not able to just change the blade itself evidently??

That's why it's probably, at this time, only for those who, one, can afford a Mercedes in the first place, and then the luxury of having the money to burn to replace it when it wears out and I suspect maybe a thousand dollars or more when the blades need replacing on a bus (???). It must be noted that there's a heating element integrated in the blade assembly too adding to the cost.

We was going to be using the camper around the first of the year for a trip so we thought that would be easier. Found out some water did not get blew out for some reason. It didn't bust any lines or fitting. After that I will not depend on blowing out the lines. Another thing I have learned is to relieve the pressure and drain the hot water tank before switching the bypass valves. When pumping in the antifreeze I will turn the bypass valve to get antifreeze in the valve. Had water get trapped in one of the bypass valves and pushed the stem out of the valve. Luckly I was able to push the stem back in the valve and it has been good every since.",Winterizing

"Based on current temps, I assume you have already winterized. But, here is my 2 cents. I have mine in an enclosed storage in the Galveston area. It is currently mid 20's outside right now. Admittedly this is nothing compared to what people north of us are seeing (like you in OK). I blew the lines out and poured the RV antifreeze in the drains and Splendide washer/dryer (spin cycle per manual). I drained my Truma water heater.

But, my plan next year is to go ahead and do a final sweep of the lines with antifreeze. It doesn't take that long, and I'd have a better peace of mind. If I lived up in OK, even with an enclosed storage (unless it is insulated), I would definitely use antifreeze. As others have said and as others have lined me out in the past on this forum, the air just doesn't do an awesome sweep. A good test is to sweep it with air then come back a few minutes later and see that more water comes out. You can keep doing that or just use antifreeze and be done. If only using air, unswept water will settle in low points and possibly freeze a fitting or maybe a valve and could cause damage. Yes, as someone else pointed out, be careful to use your user manual for your Oasis for special instructions. I've seen several people on this forum post about not winterizing their Truma Aqua Go water heater per the manual, and it cost them big time for something that is very easy to winterize. ",Winterizing
"What does your owner's manual say? Do that and don't worry.

But here are likely incomplete instructions:

Since you have an Oasis, you will need to pump RV antifreeze through the system. It will displace all the water. No need to blow out with air first (which requires filtration for the air or a oil-less compressor). Get full-strength red fluid out of every tap, hot and cold. Make sure it's enough to fill the drain traps, too. Don't forget the shower and outside shower. You might have a 3-way valve to make this easy or you might need to take the inlet off the water pump and use an adapter to connect the hose to the RV antifreeze containers.

If you have a washer or washer/dryer, a dishwasher, or an icemaker (or any combination) you will need to follow the instructions for each appliance. Compressed air won't winterize those lines, either.

Make sure all the tanks and low point drains are empty. If you have a black water tank flush, use that too. It helps to tilt the coach to the left a bit.

I use 5-6 gallons of RV antifreeze a year. Your coach might need 3, or 7, but you'll need more than one and fewer than 10. If you get 8 you'll probably have a head start on next year's supply.

Hope these ramblings are helpful.

(Edit) It appears that for at least some Oasis models, you can use the fresh water drain and optionally compressed air to winterize the unit *or* use RV antifreeze. See https://www.manualslib.com/manual/12...S.html?page=11 Find and use the manual for yours, though, to be sure. ",Winterizing
"Search is always a good idea, but the manuals are often a better source for information about winterization procedures. Also, the OP has an Oasis. Similar but not the same, so the procedures might differ.

For AH, though, from the 450DE Service Manual on p. 112:

""Please follow these instructions when winterizing the Aqua-Hot’s Domestic Water Heating System; reference Figure F1:
1. Completely drain the fresh water storage tank.
2. Disconnect the domestic water demand pump’s suction line from the fresh water storage tank.
3. Attach an adequate piece of hose onto the suction side of the domestic water demand pump.
4. Place the opposite end of the hose into an adequate supply of FDA-approved “GRAS” RV Antifreeze, and turn on the demand water pump.
Open and close all interior and exterior water faucets, one at a time, until only pure RV Antifreeze is present. Perform this procedure for both the hot and cold faucets.
6. Turn off Demand Water pump and remove the hose and re-connect the domestic water demand pump’s suction line to the fresh water storage tank.""

The only mention of compressed air is in the Warning box:

""An FDA approved “GRAS” rated winterization antifreeze must be used. YOU CANNOT BLOW DOMESTIC WATER COIL OUT WITH AIR TO WINTERIZE AQUA-HOT."" In other words, using compressed air is neither necessary nor sufficient. ",Winterizing
"I used the blow only method successfully for many years on my last rig. Last coach was much more basic. I would NOT trust that method with my DS or OP's Dutch Star. Reason being bath & a half, ice maker, washing machine, dishwasher, etc. These are all things I didn't have in my last rig. Many more water lines to worry about getting blown out. ",Winterizing
"The easiest thing to do, after you drain the freshwater tank, and the hot water tank, is to let the low point drain for several hours, then run RV antifreeze through the entire system. Of course, you have to turn the water heater bypass valve. For some odd reason my motorhome won’t draw from an RV antifreeze bottle. I drain the point drain for a few hours, then use an air pump to pump as much water out of the low point drain as I can. Then I blow air out of each fixture three or four times until nothing comes out. I start at the farthest point from the air pump location. Even if you use the RV antifreeze method you should still let the low point drain for several hours first.",Winterizing
"I have always just blown out everything and just put antifreeze in the drain P traps.

It takes longer with the icemaker in the fridge and washer/drier as well as the 2 filters, but I don't have any antifreeze taste the next year. We cook and drink from the fresh water tank. If you don't cook or drink from the FW tank, use the antifreeze. Your choice. ",Winterizing
"The Aquahot manual is for the Aquahot...not for the washer / dryer and all other connections in the water system (hot AND cold).
Yes, using just antifreeze will likely work fine as it does displace the water. More thorough is to remove all ""easy to move"" water with air and THEN use antifreeze. Takes less antifreeze too as it's easier to know all hoses are filled with antifreeze when the flow transitions from Air to Antifreeze than it is from Water to Antifreeze.

But, the key part that many people mess up is you HAVE to use antifreeze as air alone won't move the water in the multiple coils in the Aquahot.

And, I didn't see that he has an Oasis as he posted that in response to my post.

You likely have Oasis heat and ITR specifically states that blowing out is not sufficient. So blow out first, if available is a best practice IMO and what I and many do, but then pump pink AF throughput the system.
Of course, drain tanks before. Read & follow the manual for winterizing.

Also, I had problem with water fill solenoids on washer after using alcohol based AF. Had to replace both and have switched to using propylene glychol based AF since w/o any issues.

We also have macerator toilets which I flush while on air, this draws the water level in the throat way down, so it takes less antifreeze to winterize.
I follow a detailed checklist I made for my coach, but basically blow everything out, pump antifreeze through the AquaHot, stools, antifreeze in drains, then leave all lines & faucets open. Takes about 2 1/2 gal. We sometimes get below 0* temperatures. ",Winterizing

"We have a 2015 Newmar Ventana LE 4381. We are on the road. Yesterday, we got shut out of our rig because of the failure of the Trimark door latch on the entry door. Fortunately we had our cell phones, but not much else. We called a locksmith to no avail, understandably, because, as we discovered soon enough, the door was not locked. Something else was amiss. The local Newmar dealer service tech was kind enough to take our call (it's a weekend, y'all - no one makes house calls, Newmar is closed and our extended warranty provider is a joke (another story for another thread)). The local service tech asked questions about our situation -- the door handle was very loose with no give to it at all -- and helped us to understand that the door latch pinion (for lack of a better term) that inserts into the door jamb had failed. Our only option was to enter the rig another way. With our model, he explained that the only viable manner of ingress was the driver's side window, which, of course, was locked. Folks, we worked on trying to unlock that window for four hours. Without a sophisticated means of trying to bust the lock on the driver's window, we ended up having to break the glass. We'll be driving East today with plastic over a window, making all of us Newmar owners proud, I'm sure. The short of the long is, CHECK YOUR DOOR LATCH FREQUENTLY to ensure the pinion hasn't loosened up or REPLACE IT. If you still have the OEM door latch, it's a bad situation waiting to happen. Google the issue and you'll find this is not new news. It's a TriMark issue that is RV brand neutral. Why there hasn't been a recall is a head scratcher, but I'm looking at potentially $2500 plus for a new window. ",Door Locks and Parts
"Sorry to hear about your problems with the latch. I recently read about it elsewhere and that thread linked this aftermarket fix: https://www.latchfix.com/

I don’t know anything about the company, so I’m not endorsing it but it may be worth investigating.

Because a door latch is a safety issue, you should file a complaint with NHTSA. That’s how recalls get started. ",Door Locks and Parts
"Was the issue the deadbolt, or the actual latch? I have been temporarily locked out several times due the the deadbolt not retracting all the way. Several methods work, Had the best luck with slamming the deadbolt key while banging, I mean really hard, on the door in the latch area. I keep a little graphite on it now to keep it lubricated.


On another note, sometimes my electric lock on the latch fails. This is due to the contacts on the hinge edge of the door getting corroded or dirty. I just clean them with a little WD-40 and a rag (spray the WD-40 on the rag first) every now and then to keep them clean.

"The main issue with the Tri Mark lock sets is the cheap pot metal casting that's spring loaded for the door strike. There's a thinner area the spring goes around that eventually fails causing the latch to go into the strike due to the spring and loosing the ability to pull it back out via the handle.

I've replaced the lock 3 times on my 2006 Georgetown, once locked out and twice locked in. Locked in is easier to fix as the lock and trim around the door can be partially dismantled and the strike pushed / pulled back to open the door and fully remove the lock and remove the broken strike. Using the deadbolt to secure the door while traveling.

From the outside requires some ingenuity in getting a thin flat device into the strike area to push it back to unlock the door - nor fun at all an may end up marring the outside.

Leaving a window uocked to be able to get back in is the best option (lessons learned) to unlock the coach.

Tri Mark should be making the strike from cast steel or billet aluminum that can take the ""snap"" that occurs when the door is closed not using the handle to keep the strike pulled back and releasing it slowly to latch the door - another thing leaned to get more longevity in these cheaply made latches.",Door Locks and Parts

After being locked out one time, we got spare door keys for the trimark locks (2 different keys). We keep 1 set in each of our vehicles to ensure we will never be locked out again since we use the code to enter and never take the remotes or key rings.

"Two of the ""alignment plate bin brackets"" used for baggage doors with electric locks broke and the Newmar Parts catalog had them listed for $48 (Newmar Part # is 020658A). I contacted a fellow IRV2 contributor, friend, and Ventana owner and asked if he could make these on his 3D printer. The 3D printed version was not strong enough but he realized plastic cutting boards are about the same thickness and decided to fabricate them out of some old cutting boards using a drill press and band saw. His design included improvements to the original by increasing the thickness in a crucial pressure point and trimming some material away so the cable release had more room to operate. As an aside, one of my cable release pieces was frayed, and I did buy those replacements from Newmar (about $2.37 each). I would recommend checking those periodically and having a few spares on hand in case you find any that need replacing.

"Ever since new, my coach has never made a clean swipe of the windshield. Living in California, we've only had to use the wipers on two occasions in 3.5 years, so it has never been a big issue. However, I would like them to work correctly.

Mine lay horizontal with the pivoting ends at the left and right outer edge of the windshield. In the photo below, the green area does not wipe cleanly. It doesn't chatter, just won't give a clean wipe.

Here's what I've done to date.....I replaced both 36"" wipers with new blades and got the same result. It should be noted that the passenger side with the 36"" blades always wiped cleanly. I found that the passenger ""blade"" was perpendicular to the glass and the driver's side was at a slight angle. I bent the arm to make the driver's side perpendicular, no help. My dealers' service department recommended that I put more of a bend in the arm, adding some pressure to the wiper blade. That made no difference.

I never cared for the fragility of the wiper arms with the 36"" blades and changed them two months ago to 32"". They swipe a path that's higher than my view out the windshield, so they work well in that aspect. However, I'm still getting a swipe that misses the lower corners, now on both sides.

The wiper arms have large springs that hold the arm against the glass. I guess they could be weak, but this has been an issue since new.

If someone has had the same issue on their Newmar with the same wiper setup, and found a fix, I'm all ears. My next step will be to add some sort of airfoil or wing to the blades to force them against the windshield while moving. ",Wiper Parts

What I did do that made a huge difference was use RejeX on the windshield. Most of the time I don't have to use the wipers in the rain because the water just beads off but when I do use the wipers they do a much better job.

It's a called a surface sealant and it is really slick. It's very easy to apply and I use is on the entire coach, and most of the time I just pressure wash the coach with DI water and it comes clean.

That is impossible to do without pulling the back wall out of the closet so I put lap sealant around the wires and that part of the light before I screwed them in. Hard to know if that made a water tight seal or not. It appeared the factory put some type of sealant around the top of the lights as flashing to redirect the water since there is a gasket between the base of the light and the fiberglass. Does anybody know what this is? It appeared to probably be clear when it was new but was now a dark yellow and was pretty hard. It did not look like lap sealant or silicone. I started to put lap sealant in that place but thought I would ask others opinions first.,"Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
I have an ‘02 Mountain Aire DP with a fiberglass roof. I’ve used Dicor self leveling sealant since purchasing the unit in 2015. I’ve also had some issues with leaks. I just watched a YouTube video by AZ Expert where he stated Dicor will not seal to a fiberglass roof and to use silicone self leveling sealant. What say ye?,"Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"

Dicor wont seal to silicone. Watching his video on replacing a shower sunlight he uses silicone to seal the sunlight then dicor to disperse water away from the silicone,"Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"Watched the video and see your point. I suppose there is some potential for ambiguity here. Does he mean : 1) don’t use Dicor on this roof because it is fiberglass, or 2) don’t use Dicor on this specific roof because silicon has already been used on the roof? Either way, AZ expert is being unclear and I can see why you concluded that Dicor shouldn’t be used on fiberglass roofs. For the record, Dicor sticks well to my fiberglass roof. :-)","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"If you’ve never applied Eternabond, it helps to have two people when applying to coach roof seams.","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"So I noticed the skylight caulk has turned brown and is starting to get some spider cracks on the sealant. I assumed it was just Dicor self leveling, but I've seen some other posts that suggest Surebond SB-140.

Before I hit up Newmar, figured I'd check in here to see what the consensus is. Also, is it good practice to replace the skylight if you're going this work, or do they last a while? We're going on 6 years with it, and seems fine other than usual scratches from branches and such.

What are you folks using to re-seal the skylight? ","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
I used the Surebond SB-140. It is chemically compatible with the polycarbonate skylight material. This is the same sealant that Newmar used in the factory. Other sealants may cause crazing of the polycarbonate. No need to replace the skylight unless it is cracked.,"Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"It's SB-140. You CANNOT prep it with denatured alcohol, it will just damage the existing layer more. Have to do a clean scrape and replace, preferably with a few layers built up instead of the single pass Newmar does. SB-140 is not self leveling, you have to use a putty knife to spread it out across the surfaces.","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"I saw some videos of them using mineral spirits to get off the old stuff, that's still safe right? I do have a fiberglass roof, so not worried about the TPO stuff.","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"Here's some pics of my handy work. Few things to note, need two tubes of SB-140. Also next time I'll probably also just buy a new cover as well as it took FOREVER to clean the old sealant off both sides of the cover. The sealant is also super squishy and even after almost a week, feels like it's still wet. I don't like that.

Lastly, it's not easy working with that stuff, it leaves little stringy dribble trails everywhere. I'll probably redo this during the summer when I get back, as I don't think I did a great job and the single tube just barely got the edges covered.

It's a good thing I changed this when I did though, as I was removing the old cover, there was two spots where water was starting to get into the edge of the sealant. ","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"You need another tube or two, that's insufficient coverage on the screws as it will harden and flex off after a couple months. You're not supposed to have stringy dribbles because you're supposed to put it on thick and spread it with a trowel. Normally you need minimum 4-6 tubes of SB-140 to do a skylight correctly. You applied that as if it was a self leveling sealant, SB-140 is NOT a self leveling sealant. It feels ""wet"" because you haven't spread it correctly.

Basically it needs to at least look like the original installation- but thicker. At least if you're planning to redo it you haven't really wasted much yet.

PS: I think Newmar dispenses it from 50 gallon tubs with a hand shovel :P ","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"Good to know, thank you. All I had was the tip of the caulk tube to spread it around. It seems like even if you spread it around and there's a lot more that it'll stay pretty wet/squishy.

I'll plan on re-doing it this summer and will keep checking it every week or so. ","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"
"I accidentally stepped on the shower skylight and it broke (somewhat brittle after 7 years on the roof). Bought a new one from Newmar Parts (Part# 55613) for $74.00 and installed it today. None of the original screw holes lined up with the new part, so had to drill 31 new holes. And the predrilled holes in the new part were not uniformly spaced - odd. I used PT-140 caulk under the new skylight and based on reading some of the earlier posts here, I will need to add more caulk to make it look more like the original install.","Adhesives, Sealants, and Cleaners"

"Newmar used double magnetic catches for many of the cabinets in our 2023 New Aire.

After a year and a half, we've had multiple catches fail. The pin retaining the magnet breaks - causing the magnet to get loose and the door to open while driving.

Last week, this happened to the lower bar cabinet behind the living room slide out, causing some large plastic pasta sauce bottles to drop onto the floor.

When we opened the slideout, we didn't realize those bottles where there - and the trim piece on the front of the slideout popped off, before we could stop the slide.

So having these catches fail could pose a risk while driving, depending upon what's in the cabinet and where the cabinet is located.

It's easy to replace the catches (BP33772AL Amerock).

And...

It's also easy to take some preventative action - by applying duct tape ontop of the catches to prevent the pins from popping out when they break - keeping the magnet inside the catch.

This is especially important for those catches which are located on the top or sides of a cabinet, where the pins can easily pop out when they break. ",Hardware
"I found on my 2023 New Aire a bunch of these double magnetic door catches, but then discovered all the doors only had single metal strike plates installed on the doors. I was like ""Why did they even bother?"" I ended up buying a bunch so I could add the missing 2nd strike plates to all my cabinet doors. They stay latched much better now, especially the pantry...

Best,
-Mark ",Hardware
"Adding the second plate also provides redundancy so that if one magnet does get loose, you can use the second magnet.

The downside of using both is that it can make it more difficult to open the door.

We've had a few doors that were too hard to open, even with only a single striker plate. Adjusting the magnet position (pushing it a little back into the cabinet) helped.

We've also purchased several extra sets of the plastic catches used on our bedroom closet sliding doors and the two ceiling exhaust vents. We've already had one of those break. ",Hardware

A/C work is always expensive and there is no gaurantee that this is the only leak.

"On my 2023 Newman New Aire my three vent panels keep dropping from the ceiling. It appears that the magnets they compression fit into the wood panel frames with some CA glue keep popping out of the wood. Once enough of them work their way loose from their sockets the entire panel drops.

I've tried prying them off the metal rail they adhere to, pushing them back into the wooden frame where it has been milled to hold them, as well as gluing them back in (thick CA). They still pop out as CA and magnets don't adhere well.

I am thinking of four possible solutions. One is to use strips of magnetic tape with 3M adhesive on the wooden frame (stapled). The second is to bore the magnet holes out deeper so they are flush with the wood and apply a super thin acrylic over them (will the magnets still hold the panel in place if not making physical contact with the metal frame in the ceiling?). Third is to try a coat of epoxy over the magnets and wood (may try this first). Lastly, is to punt and instead attach some velcro, stapling to the wood and some epoxy to the metal frame.

Anybody else having this issue? If so, what has worked to solve the problem in your Newmar?

"My Ventana had its cover falling whenever I hit a good bump. I asked for the magnets to be installed under warranty. Instead, Newmar has NIRVC install some Southco fasteners - the same fasteners that hold the small covers for the vent fans. Hasn't fallen since.

(Note that the Ventana uses small plastic balls fitting into cups for the standard fasteners - I thought that the magnets would be an upgrade. Silly me.)",Interior
"Here are some picks for the front panel (other 2 similar) after the previous attempts to remove all the dislodged magnets from the metal on the ceiling and trying to reglue them into the wooden panel pockets. The glue sat for a week before putting the panels back in place in the ceiling.

I think perhaps Newmar didn't think this magnetic panel attachment idea through all the way. They may need to go back to the old Southco latches on future builds even they they cost more than the magnets...

"I realize that comparing my experience on a Thor Motorhome to what you can do in your Newmar may not be the same. I did replace both the low and High beam halogen bulbs with LED. First thing you will need to do is to take one low beam and on high beam out and find out what the bulb number designation is. In my case both the low and high used the H9 bulb. Then I searched Amazon for:

""h9 led headlight bulb""

which pulled up this one.

https://www.amazon.com/Termitor-H11-...1zcF9hdGY&th=1

You do need to be careful choices pulled up are often not clear about how many bulbs you get for the price. So, that really good price you see might only be on bulb. It is better if you buy in pairs. when you buy singles you can end up $10 dollars more per bulb. ",Lights
"I would also caution that some of the LED bulbs on Amazon are so bright, they have the potential to be a blinding hazard for on-coming traffic. This includes so called low beam LEDs. I had to really research which bulbs had acceptable watts for both low and high beams. Just because the bulb will light up three miles in front of me, I chose to be responsible and courteous, and I got lights that are much brighter than the POS OEM.",Lights

"Good for you for being responsible and considering oncoming traffic. I have used a large piece of cardboard out front to check the light cut-off patterns. It works great to align your lights.

Some of the cheap LED replacements are terrible. There are good ones out there, but usually expensive. They should be adjustable to get the correct light pattern for both high and low beam.

I have always been happy with Sylvania replacement bulbs. They work fine and last pretty good. Just make sure you're getting full voltage to them. Usually around 13 to 14 volts with the engine running. ",Lights
"Don’t get too geeked up about lights. I did a revamp on my lights a few years ago. I replaced the entire assembly. Very nice setup. The lights lite up the road for a change. We were on a trip in Arizona. Deer flew across the road. No more lights. Never even used them at night save for aiming.

I got the rig repaired and new lights. All is well. There are several aftermarket light suppliers. Great investment. I did not go led because there was more to it then just replacing bulbs. I did go with Sylvania advanced bulbs. ",Lights
"I checked that when I made the switch. Of course, the High Beam is blinding both with the original bulbs and with the LEDs. You can quibble about the LED being more blinding, but it is blinding with the old bulbs as well. The low beams had the exact same light pattern as with the old Halogen bulbs yes, the LEDs are brighter but do not direct the low beam into the eyes of oncoming traffic and are no brighter or blinding than the OEM LED lights on my Jeep.",Lights
"A couple of things about headlights. First, when you drive in your car, you're pretty much sitting a few inches above the headlights and you're looking down the beam of the headlight like you would be looking down the barrel of a rifle. In this position, you can see the road better.

Fast forward to a Class A and you're well above the headlights and you're looking down at an angle from above at a beam that is well below you. This phenomenon is why the headlights don't look as bright. The headlights used in your Class A, are automobile headlight assemblies. My Dutch Star lights are from a Dodge Challenger. You don't hear anyone complaining that their Challenger headlights with halogen bulbs don't work. Typically, you drive a car even faster and don't have issues with the lighting.

Adding LED or HID to a standard halogen light housing (a housing where you can see the bulb by looking in) does not improve lighting. Yes, it will throw light everywhere and when pulling into a campground, you'll light everything directly in front of you, including the trees, like daylight. This is why people think the bulbs help. But....they don't change any of the lighting ""down the road"" where you need to be able to see at 55 mph to 65 mph.

LED or HID bulbs need to be ""FOUSED"". If you look at the new cars, they're using a concentrated lens in the center of the light housing (the owl eye looking lens). The LED lenses FOCUS the light down the road, giving the great lighting you see on new cars. Adding these same bulbs to a standard lens causes the light to ""scatter"" everywhere, appearing brighter.

A couple of solutions, if your new Bay Star has the focus lens, you could probably improve the down the road lighting with an LED bulb replacement. If you have the standard lens, your only help would be to add some driving lights, possibly where your fog lights are located. They can be directed further down the road and give you that ability to see at 60mph.

On my Dutch Star, I can replace the headlight assembly with one from a higher end Dodge Challenger. They offer the Challenger lenses in halogen, LED and HID. It would be a nice upgrade, but expensive. You have to buy the lenses for about $300 a piece and then the bulbs for another $200.00.

If you drive at night on a regular basis, add the Driving Lights or change out your lenses. I like doing projects and upgrading things on my coach, but I just couldn't justify the expense of changing the lenses since I've only driven the coach once at night in five years. ",Lights

"While I rarely drive at night, I am a huge advocate for daytime running lights and the safety they provide during the day. The quote/unquote daytime running lights offered on my Ventana are 2 LED dot lights under each headlamp. These 2 dot lights provide very little if any benefit to being a DRL, so I explored my options.

There is one aftermarket headlight assembly offered by Spyder lighting, however I don’t care for the look and would, IMO, diminish the look of the coach. With my options limited, I reached out to Oracle Lighting who is known for aftermarket HALO daytime running lights. They were able to add HALO lights to the 2013 Durango headlight assembly used in the Ventana.

It took a while to receive the lights but gave me time to build a couple of plug and play pigtail harnesses that would use the side marker light wire to power the DRLs.

The install was easy and with my adapters was a simple plug and play. There are 3 small screws/nuts that hold each headlight assembly to the front cap. When I was removing the original headlight assemblies from the coach, I was a bit surprised to see that all 6 of the little screws/nuts were very loose. Two of them were so loose that the nuts were about to come off. The problem was Newmar used regular nuts and not nylon lock nuts.

1. Remove the screws from the support strut and other hinge, if it has not popped out too, and set the door aside.

2. Remove the screws from the dowel-like insert plugs. You may have to hold the plugs with pliers when removing the screws. Don't worry about marring them, they won't show and any additional will just provide better glue ""tooth.""

3. Use a good wood glue (I like TiteBond III) and coat the outside of the inserts with it. With a toothpick, swab some glue on the inside of the holes in the cabinet frame. Do not put glue on the round hinge body hole or hinge body that seats in the hole; it will make future disassembly difficult.

4. Tap the insert plugs into the hole, covering with a paper towel or rag to prevent glue from squirting out. Don't ask how I know about this step. Seat the insert fully into the hole. Wipe up any excess glue with a damp paper towel or rag.

5. Let the glue dry per the manufacturer's instructions.

6. Reassemble the hinges to the cabinet frame.

There you have it.

Good luck.",Hardware

Three were fixed by Newmar under warranty (tech used Sikaflex adhesive and gave me the rest of the tube for future repairs); the other three I did myself.

"Yep...happened on several of the cabinets in our 2014 Ventana LE; always on the strut side. I think the strut applies additional pressure to the hinge.

I have fixed all of the hinges by removing the door (removing all the screws from the hinge), re-gluing the plastic screw plugs in place with Titebond Polyurethane and reassembling after the glue has fully cured (45 minutes). And, yes, it really does cure in 45 minutes.

Because the plug pockets are pretty snug, clamping really isn't necessary with Titlebond Poly; just be sure the plugs are tapped in firmly after gluing and don't reassemble until the glue has cured. ",Hardware

"I assume you're wanting to move the arm farther out where it attaches to the bracket on the front cap. You're on the right track, just loosen the nut, if it's stuck try a rubber mallet or some method to bump the arm to crack it loose without any damage. There usually aren't any set screws in that joint. Once you get the arm out, you may need to loosen the set screws on the mirror joint to adjudt the angle of the mirror housing.",Exterior
"That mirror uses a cone shape insert over the bolt. As you tighten it, the cone really locks the mirror up tight. When you loosen the bolt, the cone doesn't necessarily release. A rubber mallet or a good whack with your palm will get the cone loose and allow the mirror to move.

I have a method when I adjust my mirrors. First, I imagine a string running the length of the coach, touching the sidewall and protruding past the front mirrors. I set the mirrors just the other side of the imaginary string, maybe adding an inch.

Once the arms are set, I adjust the mirror heads. I set the mirror glass where I want it. Often that leaves a big gap between the glass and housing on one side. I turn the housing until the glass is even on both sides. This may take several adjustments to get to that point. It helps to keep critters out of any big gaps. Once that's done, I make sure they are vertically straight, then tighten.",Exterior

"I would think it would be similar to installing an antenna on a roof rack..
But this is why I am asking questions, because I am fairly new to ham and have only used the UHF/VHF bands on my mobile. I really want to set up a ham shack in my house (coach) and I know there are people out there that have done this but the information is either very old or limited on what I can find on the subject.. Running the coax and finding ground plane is the tough part of this adventure.. :-) ",Exterior
"You're throwing HF in the mix, which is an entirely different scale than V/U. HF is difficult on an RV - it's big, but it's not a groundplane like the solid metal surface of a car or truck. Problem with using the framing is they'll act more like radials than a plane, which means you'll have RF current and voltage nodes all over the place. That translates to potential for EMI and RFI inside, and also weird resonances that can affect the tuning of the antenna. Not saying you shouldn't try it, because not having radials or a counterpoise creates it's own set of problems that are generally worse. This is best approached by deciding what capabilities you want to have - mobile, stationary, what bands, what power levels. Before you go all-in on a solution, some testing with a mockup antenna in the proposed location can reveal whether it's a viable idea or not.",Exterior
"I'd be tempted to do two or three things....
Get a UHF/VHF antenna that doesn't require a ground plane like a Comet SBB5
I have one on my truck and wouldn't hesitate to put it on the trailer.
EHAM has some write up about it.
SSB5 on Eham

Possibly a screwdriver antenna for HF, but as was stated above, there will be a lot of metal nearby to create add reflections that will interfere with tuning.

I realize it's not convenient however a ground mounted vertical on a pole in a tripod with a counterpoise with as long of wire as space allows, or a G5Rv hung from a tree (read ""L"" or inverted V) would get better xmit/reception. You'll still need a tuner though. Military fiberglass camo net poles are easy to pack, strong and will get the peak of the antenna up, BUT not the best choice if it's windy.

BTW, if you don't have one, a VNA (vector network analyzer) is a Very handy tool for tuning and other diagnostics. ",Exterior
"Mark,
I was thinking of using a screwdriver antenna (maybe Tarheel vertical) for the HF side of things and will only be pushing 100 watts max on the coach..

"OK, nominal power and performance. The issue with putting any antenna on an RV much less HF is clearance. You're already 12ft plus to roof level, adding an 8ft long pole on the top is a quick way to trim trees, find low bridges and power wires. Putting the antenna alongside the body is problematic because the structure will both detune it and impact efficiency. I have a long time ham friend that was full time several years. He ran a screwdriver antenna on his Bounder, liked to do HF APRS underway. This sounds kinda funny but he had the antenna mounted horizontally from the top of his roof ladder facing backwards. He pulled a toad so having this rearward protrusion wasn't a clearance issue, and the thing actually worked pretty well. So depending on your expectation of performance you can come up with a few different schemes that could work out OK but it might take a few stabs at it to find it. I've been running HF mobile for decades in my cars and trucks but so far I haven't been motivated to go through all that for the RV. Driving the RV takes far more attention than pointing a car down the interstate and adding HF mobile to the mix is too much of a distraction for me. There's nothing better to wile away highway hours than working a CW contest or working some giant pileup but I guess I'll save that for car trips. So I've skipped any HF mobile for the RV, concentrating on fixed operation after arrival. I've always loved to work portable HF when camping or traveling and since the advent of SOTA/POTA I'm having a blast with that. Sometimes one has to be a little more discrete with antennas depending on the campground or park but I always make it happen.

"I would offer, having been around this block a few times, having an HF antenna on the RV for stationary operation is a bit of a handicap. It's the lowest common denominator for performance, it's expensive, and an opportunity for EMI/RFI unless you get lucky. Contrasted to an antenna, or antennas not limited to mobile performance you pluck from a basement compartment, and can be placed at or far away from the RV as needed/possible. Yes, there's a convenience aspect that may have priority, but just planting the seed that convenience comes at a cost. Establish your operating goals, then work backwards from there to arrive at the antenna solution. Versus deciding on the antenna solution and having to accept whatever it offers.

"There are several options for RV washing. The first is to wash it yourself. It’s really no different than washing your car, but you’ll need a ladder and a sponge/mop with a long handle.

The next option is to use a truck wash service like Blue Beacon. I use these occasionally, especially if I’m on the road and I’ve driven in dirty conditions. They’re available at selected truck stops across the country. They aren’t great, but they remove the majority of the dirt from your RV’s exterior. There’s almost always a line, so the process takes about 30 - 45 minutes. It’s about $40, depending on the size of your RV and the options that you choose.

The third option is to hire a professional RV detailing service. I do this occasionally at the start of the season. In fact, I’m having this done on Saturday.

I spray the coach down with the garden hose, then spray it down with the foam cannon, attack it with my Marry Moppins wool pad on a telescoping pole & bucket of clean water, rinse & call it good. Sometimes I hand dry it. If your wheels are a polished & sealed aluminum product keep harsh wheel cleaners away & use only soap & water.

To ensure that doesn’t get messed up I reached out to them for approved products along with going through the paperwork provided.

They recommended either Mothers or Meguires wax products. I’m using the Meguires ultimate liquid wax with a Ryobi 5 inch 18 volt buffer at 3800 rpm to polish.

The other product for the diamond shield is 303 Aerospace protectant which they approve for use.

" Winterizing ElectricRefer
Hello!

Using coach over a cold weekend - will need to re-winterize coach since we're returning to colder weather tomorrow. I'm unclear on best way to ensure I have antifreeze in the ice maker in the refer.

Thanks in advance for any advice! ",Winterizing
"If it is winterized currently, I would suggest closing the valve under the refer in the basement
area. If you close the valve, there is no need to re-winterize the refrig since the pink stuff would stay in the lines leading up to and including the water dispenser and ice maker. Same with the washing machine if you have one...close the hot and cold water valves to the washer before de winterizing and it will remain winterized.

If you have already de winterized then I think you will need to push the pink stuff through the water lines and ice maker again. I would start by pushing the pink stuff through the water lines, then, if you have a water dispenser, allow the pink stuff to get to there, then leave the system pressurized and make a couple batches of ice. Good luck ",Winterizing
"Following the winterizing directions in the wet bay was easy enough and I know the water lines to the faucets & toilet are winterized but the ice maker & washer was a challenge.

I read tips on winterizing and it seems there are different ways that work and I'm hoping what I did falls in that category. For the ice maker, I made ""ice"" with the antifreeze. A cycle of real ice popped out then the 2 batches were clear slushies. I left the fridge on overnight but turned off the ice maker & this morning the slushies were less slushie & more frozen but not as hard as the real ice. Of course, the temp in the freezer was close to zero. I thought I'd make another batch of slushies to be safe.

For the washer, I ran a cycle on cold until the pink stuff showed up in the drum, then cancelled & spun. I repeated that for the hot water.

This is how the former owner winterized but she also ran the Oasis burner & furnace set at the lowest temp last winter. We really don't want to do that but could for the coldest nights. Our coach is at home & in her own garage with 20amp so it'd be easy enough to do.

Have I missed anything? ",Winterizing
"Did you hear the pink stuff being drained though the drain hose? Mine is noisy and pretty easy to hear...

Many washer drain hoses make a giant loop from bottom of the washer up to the top of the drain pipe. At the bottom of the loop and at the bottom of the drain pipe, water will sit. You need to evacuate enough pink stuff to get the water out of the bottom of that loop replaced with pink stuff.

The drain pipe is easy to winterize 'cause you can just pour pink stuff down the hole.

Your washer plumbing may be different, but I'd evacuate pink stuff just to be sure.",Winterizing

My 12v store switch is on the energy management system panel, over the passenger side dash; but that is for a 2000 Dutch Star.

Give us more information on model year.

BTW... many of us don't flush antifreeze throughout the whole water system. We drain the hot water heater, water and sewage tanks and blow-out the water piping with air. And then just use antifreeze in the traps and any other low points that won't drain completely. ",Winterizing

Are you staying in the MH in Moscow or just leaving it there where it will be parked in the cold? If you are staying in it you don't need to do anything. No winterizing would be necessary. If you're leaving it in the cold then the safest way is to run rv antifreeze through the entire system. Don't forget the ice maker and the washing machine.,Winterizing
"Unfortunately it is getting close to the time of year that I have to put my Coach away for the winter.

Keep waiting for the year I can head south for the winter, but we're not there yet.

This is the first year for storing this coach.

I understand the winterizing of the water system from having trailers, had a black flush on that trailer, so I'll remember that part too. Washing machine is the only new item to learn about, no dishwasher or ice maker

As for other stuff

When I park it, should I dump the air and put it on the HWH jacks? or just park it.

Parking on gravel, tires will be covered, should I put anything between tires and gravel?

Should I take all batteries out, coach and chassis? or is the solar charger enough to keep the cold from killing the chassis batteries?
I used to remove battery on TT and put it on a smart charger in basement at home. Can do same with coach batteries.

We used to put dryer sheets throughout the trailer and never had an issue with mice, so plan on doing the same thing.

Was hoping to leave all the camping gear in the coach.

Was going to top up the fuel and propane. Is there a recommended additive for Diesel fuel when it is stored

Any advice is appreciated, still got a few weeks and a couple of short trips.

Thanks ",Winterizing
"I've read the tires should be parked fully inflated on a dry surface. Even though it'll be on gravel if the site is low and the gravel remains wet I'd park it on a 2x? to keep them high and dry.

For long term storage I always remove the batteries then store them connected to a smart charger. Has always worked for me.

My son-in-law tried dryer sheets but they didn't work for him. The previous owner of my trailer stored it in a barn year round. He stuffed steel wool into any little opening the mice might try to chew through to gain entry but he never had any mice. Looking through the coach I couldn't find any evidence they got in so his method apparently worked. I'd also remove ALL food or any pans that might have a food odor on them. This would include a bbq.

A diesel fuel stabilizer probably wouldn't hurt. Consult your engine manual first though",Winterizing
"Washer: run a hot and cold fill with the antifreeze in the system (not a complete fill cycle to save some antifreeze). then, a spin to get most of the water / antifreeze solution out. I do that twice.

Ice maker: My manual says pull the water line to the ice maker and no need for antifreeze. Something I have to investigate today on where the connection within the icemaker is and how to access it. ",Winterizing

" Amber turn signal light on mirror
Hey all, Anyone know where to look for fuse or wiring for the driver side amber signal light that is at the bottom of the mirror arm? The light works on the bench, havent metered the wires yet (raining) but assume there is not juice when left signal is on, where do I look.

Newmar diagrams don't spell it out....

Thanks ",Lights
There is no specific fuse for that. There is a 6 pin connector at the bottom of the mirror base next to the genset. You need to check power there. Usually the light assembly is the issue. Are all of your other clearance lights and blinkers working? Those fuse are in the rear next to the chassis batteries in a fuse holder. There might be one in the front run bay under the driver window. There is wiring running through the arm. You can check at the plug or at the light. Only places you can get to without a disassemble of the arm.,Lights

It works GREAT you aren't pushing up against the ceiling material, you just hook it under the rim and pull down or you can rock gently with the angle it against the ceiling for more leverage if needed... It is not for the ones that are screwed into the ceiling... ",Lights
purchased a 2002 newmar mountain aire 4095 this past year still learning somethings. can anyone tell me where the light switch is to turn on the ceiling rope lights. i know the one in the bedroom but not the ones in bathroom or living room.thanks,Lights
"On mine, there are 110 to 12 volt transformers that feed the LEDs. The front LEDs transformer was on the passenger AV mini cabinet behind the pass seat. In the bedroom the transformer is in a cabinet next to the TV. The 12 volt lines go up to the ceiling and connect to the LED strips on the passenger side of the RV. I think the wall switch connects to the 12 volt side of the transformer and the transformer is always on (there is a power switch on it as well - which might be why the lights aren't turning on if this is OFF)

To remove the old, yellow, outdated LED (the ones you hit with the spatula), you remove the trim (long thin nails). Then pry out the LEDs from their ceiling channel and pull out the cut end from the drivers sidewall. At this point, I would measure the diameter of the old rope light and buy replacement rope light in bulk online. It's a weird size so not a lot of options what I found...When you get the new lights in hand, continue... Once that end is out, then pulling rest of rope is easy.

Now, on the passenger side be careful...because the wire side of the rope LED is fatter than the rest of rope. If you pull too hard, you might pull off the wire which is then ""lost"" in the ceiling. So, I would try to pull it out, but if resistance, then open up the hole diameter with a small drill or blade. Pull out the rope end with the attachment wire.

If you loose the wire (or it won't pull out enough), then you will have to cut a slot down the wall (to be hidden by the molding) You can use a reciprocating saw like Fein. You can then try to find / dig out the wire and put additional length on it (ideally with soldered connection).

You can then connect a newer same diameter 12 volt white LED strip to the old wires. Test wiring polarity because one way the LED will work, the other won't. Insulate the wires without getting the rope too fat. Insert back into the wall. Put the new rope into the channel. Cut the end to length (a little more than what is needed but at the rope LED cut lines) and push the extra into the drivers wall hole.

Put the molding back up, use a finishing gun air nailer to resecure.

The old yellow lights really dated the interior. Putting new clear, white lights ""brightened"" up the place.

And while I was at it, I also upgraded the fluorescent fixtures to flush mounted LED pucks. ",Lights
"I posted before about the rope lights in my 2002 madp I found out the previous owner disconnected the wires from the switch plugged it back in the first 5 came on the last 2 didn’t. Left them plugged in they started slowly going out 1by1until it blew the fuse,guess there’s a short. Can anyone tell me what side the connections are on I would like to replace all of them anyway. Thanks",Lights
"Yes, the electrical wiring was on passenger side of mine too.
But the connections were ""all over the place"". If you have wood molding on the side / ceiling, it might be easier to remove that, run a new wire down under where the molding will be replaced, and connect new LED lights that are white (not the old yellow ones) which will freshen up the whole interior.

that might be what I used...double check as I am not sure. The problem was finding 12volt lights that were the right diameter for the track. ",Lights
"Just bought a new to us 2009 Dutch Star 4086. Can't seem to find fuses for the closet lights and basement lights. Light bulbs appear to be good. All other 12v lights, ceiling, dining, reading etc work. Anyone out there with some suggestions? Thank you.",Lights
"There may be a master switch on the dash for the basement lights .

The fuse for my basement lights ; was marked "" Wrap lights ""

Closet lights : my coach isn't equipped with those : but usually lighting circuits on a Newmar run eight lights to a fuse , so I doubt there is a dedicated fuse for closet lighting .
Have you checked for power at the closet door switch?
Is the closet in a slide ? ",Lights
"On a 2015 Dutch Star 436669 when one opens the front door the two lights over the passenger and drivers seat come on as does the stairwell light. They are on a delay relay. When you close the door they do the same thing. Sounds good as when you open it at night you have light.

Now for the issue. When one has guests on board they are sleeping on the bed that is in the front of the coach. To let the dog out at 6:00 am not only do they hear you and the dog get by the bed but they are greeted with a bight interrogation like spot light in their faces.

I thought it would be nice if there was a switch that could cut the over heads off when the door is opened. The question here is anyone done that? It seems that it could be done by inserting a SPST switch in the ground wires for these two overhead light and the switch could go in the overhead cabinet where the tank gauges and the Oasis controls are.

I was at Newmar & had them install a switch to control the two lights, they had to go into the Silverleaf to do this, The switch was installed in the dashboard.
What my complaint was, every time you opened the door the lights came on for what seemed like several minutes & backing into a campsite at night or getting in or out at a stop then sitting there waiting for the lights to go out because of the glare was very annoying. ",Lights
"I don't have Silverleaf in my coach. I'm pretty sure on the coaches without SIlverleaf, the lights are turned on as a function of the Trimarck locking device. The Trimarck locking device is just an alarm system with various functions. One of those is to turn the lights on. On my previous coach, it turned on the exterior running lights when the door was unlocked and one light above the door.

I'm not a big fan of the lights turning on all the time. ",Lights
Yes I don't care for the auto lights either. When we enter or leave we feel like we are on display.,Lights
"""twojayhawks"".....Perfect description. There are times when I want to discretely leave the coach to check on something outside, but it can't be done when everything lights up.

Since both lights that illuminate are on their own switch, I may just look into disconnecting the function at the Trimark unit. I'm having the electric bay door locks recall done soon and it will require accessing the Trimark box. ",Lights
"Thanks Andy.....it will save me checking with a meter. I'm having the recall done next week and will have the Trimark controller out to add the harness for the bay door issue.

As a side note.....I've posted this before, the Trimark unit has a red LED on a three foot lead, that is just tied up under the dash. On both of my coaches, I extended the lead and placed the red LED in the passenger ""A"" pillar. Since it's basically an alarm, the red LED blinks when the coach is locked. It's a good deterent.",Lights
"After getting the idea from SWag and seeing his installation, I had Newmar do the same for me. I had them install the new rocker switch as the last switch in line at the far right side of the bank of switches on the face of the console. Now when I enter the coach, I can easily reach the switch while standing in the stair well. Because it is the last rocker in the row (closest to the stairs), I can locate it in the dark simply by feel if I want to turn the lights on; otherwise, my standard protocol is to leave the switch in the off position. Now the only lights that illuminate when I open the entry door are the stair well lights. It is one of the best modifications I have had done.",Lights

"I want to report that I've just had success replacing a failed summer loop pump for heat transfer fluid in our Oasis CH-50's Distribution Module with one of the below for only $87.85 plus tax, shipping, etc.

https://www.ussolarpumps.com/catalog...culating-pump/

N.B. You need to talk to Mike when ordering and say you need the ""summer loop version"" when ordering.

I did not originally talk to Mike, just ordered via the web page (a C1E 12V), and the pump that arrived had screw threads on the plastic pump housing with brass barbed adapters. This made the unit with the connectors too big to fit into the Distribution Module. When I called Mike he said ""Oh, this is for a summer loop? We have a solution for that."" He sent a replacement pump which I think had the plastic housing of the C1A model (based on the look of the nipples, sorry don't know what that is called) with 2 high quality hose adapters, 4 screw clamps, and 1 brass barbed adapter. Once you put the adapter hose on the pump outlet and tighten a clamp down, the other hose end is the right size for the Oasis fitting into the water heat exchanger. The other adapter hose clamps on the inlet, clamps on one end of the brass adapter, and then the other end of the adapter fits right into the heating hose feeding the pump with fluid. Easy peasey.

The hardest part was getting the existing hose off the bad pump. We ended up cutting our incoming hose just a bit past the nipple, and also cutting up the outgoing hose completely. The cuts aren't a problem because you will use the adapter hose lengths supplied by US Solar Pumps to make up for the missing pieces and lengths. ",Plumbing and Water

"The black drain pipe in your RV is an ABS pipe. This is different than the white PVC pipe. It's important to know the difference as your RV uses ABS, not PVC. There is a reason why, namely, durability and flexibility that does not exist in PVC.

Now doubt the drain on your RV, regardless if black or grey tank is a 3 inch bayonet mount end. It's designed to connect the ""stinky slinky"" sewer hose with a 1/4 inch, slide in and turn motion for fast and easy hook-up and disconnect.

You'll want to use a 4 inch PVC outside the camper. 4 inch PVC pipe is pretty much the standard and 4 inch PVC connections come with threaded ends so the RV ""stinky slinky"" hose connection can screw into it making a tight seal.

If you are connecting directly, then you'll want to connect the black pipe (3 inch) on your camper with the 1/4 turn bayonet end, to the 4 inch smooth PVC pipe end, then connect then with a ""boot"". ",Plumbing and Water

Has anyone installed these valves on their coach? Are these values durable?
Should I use a different manufacture? I would like a valve that works electrically but at the same time can be operate manually.

Electrical wiring and switch location is not an issue. I have a 12v power source inside the wet bay from the macerator pump that was removed. Already have easy access for the lead wire for the switch to be mounted on the inside wall of the half bath. ",Plumbing and Water
"I installed the DrainMaster 3"" electric valve on both of my Dutch Stars. I like the DrainMaster because you can buy a two-switch wiring harness. I put the second switch in the half bath. This allows me to dump anytime day or night from inside the coach.

It's really useful on departure day. I dump before we shower and then close the valve. When I bring in the slides, the tanks are empty, so I just disconnect the shore connections and off we go.

The DrainMaster has a small allen key on the side that allows you to operate it manually. ",Plumbing and Water

"No, cheap smoke detectors do NOT alarm based on heat, RoR (Rate of Rise), and certainly not in the sub-100º range.

Smoke Detectors are very sensitive to moisture (like showers), as well as dust and even cobwebs.

The usual thing to do is:

1. check the battery
2. check the date code (most detectors age out after 5 or 10 years)
3. blow it out with dry compressed air

If these maintenance items are done and it still alarms, then you're probably fighting humidity. ",Interior

"The above is sound advice, although you may have difficulty figuring out what type they are. I never really worry too much about it.

The main brands you’ll find in the major stores will be First Alert and Kidde.

A higher end option that I’m a big fan of, ESPECIALLY IN A MOTORHOME, is a remote monitored detector like the NEST. This gives you an extra level of security by letting you monitor your RV when it’s in storage or your away for the day. Of course, you must maintain a solid internet connection for this to work.

But, assuming it is the propane detector, what's been mentioned is typical, powered by the RV batteries, and they beep every 15 to 25 seconds to signal end of life, and more often when they detect propane. ",Interior
"Most propane (LP) gas detectors have a five to seven year life expectancy. At that point they must be replaced, nothing to change out, unless you are good at soldering individual components on a circuit board. There are many different sizes so get the model number from yours and purchase a new one. You just remove two screws, clip two wires and reconnect them and screw the new one back in place. Sometimes you can't find the exact replace and you may have to make the mounting hole a little bigger.


These detectors use more power than small batteries could realistically provide over a few years. So they are powered by 12 or 120 volt power. ",Interior

I just replaced the propane detector in our 2004 Mountain Aire 4301. I couldn't find power at the 2 wires no matter what I did. The manuals all said that there is a fuse; ours ""should be"" located in the bathroom at the electrical panels. There is a fuse position labeled LP Detector on the panel...

I heard from another user that Newmar said that there would be an inline fuse running to the detector itself running in the line in the wall behind the detector itself, but I could not find one there, either.
Short version: there is a switch in the front control panel where A/C thermostat, tank levels, AGS system are located, and the switch only says ""LP"" below it. I had assumed that was an electric valve opening/closing the LP tank like on other rigs that I have had, but I was wrong.
The switch sends power to the LP detector. AH! So - now everything works with new LP detector in place and switch ""On"". I added a small label below the switch so that it now reads ""LP Detector"".

"Generally speaking, 55 degrees is the lowest setting that is recommended to keep plumbing from freezing.

This is true for stick and brick construction and would certainly be true for RV's. RV's are less well insulated.

Of course how low you can go depends on the individual unit. Measuring temperature in plumbing spaces is a good way to know.

My highly modified Kodiak Cub holds at 47 degrees in the belly plumbing spaces when thermostat is set to 65 degrees. So 55 degrees would probably lower belly temperature to 37 degrees. Any lower would allow freezing.

A couple of people asked me to post if I did the air dryer filter replacement.

I've been dreading changing the Air Dryer Filter because it's soooooo hard to access. Freightliner wanted $400.00 in labor to do the job. I started and stopped the job a couple of times today, as I just couldn't see how I could get to it. There is large (nut) hose that has to be removed and very hard to access. If I couldn't get it loose, I was done. Luckily it came loose easily.

The Bendix Air Dryer unit is mounted to the driver's frame rail, between the rear tire and tag. I ran my coach up on 6"" ramps and then put blocks under the jacks. I dumped the air and drained the tanks. I extended the jacks to give me working room, but the ramps lifted the coach high enough if the jacks failed.

The Air Dryer is bolted to a bracket that is then bolted to the frame. It's also clamped at the top with a metal band. Unless the project was done over a pit or on a lift, there is no way to even reach or release the clamp at the top.

In the attached photo, you can see the metal bracket that is attached to the bottom of the air dryer. I'm pointing at the first two bolts that need to be removed, to release the air dryer assembly from the frame/bracket. The only way I was going to be able to remove the filter was to drop the air dryer assembly by moving this bracket out of the way, leaving the can still attached at the top.

Before you do any of this, there are four connections to the unit. One of the connections is a large nut (1 1/4"") that takes an actual large open end to loosen, a crescent won't fit. Loosen and remove this line, unplug the quick connect sensor and then unplug two more air hoses. They're the quick connect type, where you push in on the ring and pull the hose out.

Once the hoses are removed, you need to remove two of the eight 9/16"" nut/bolts that hold the filter cover on and are bolted through the support bracket. Once those are removed, you can work on the two 9/16"" nut/bolts that hold the bracket to the frame. These bolts were the toughest to remove of the entire project. It was tough to access the nut on the back side, but is doable. I only removed one and loosened the other. Once one is removed, the bracket can be swung down and out of the way. You'll be glad you don't have to remove both.

Now it gets easier, there are eight 9/16"" nut/bolts that hold the air dryer to the filter cover. You've already removed two. Remove five more, leaving the easiest one to access for last. Once you're down to the last one, the air dryer assembly and filter will drop out as you remove the last bolt. All eight nut/bolts had two washers each.

I took the unit out and put it on my bench. You'll most likely need a vise to hold the base as the filter is very tight. I was able to use a large pair of vise grips to spin the filter off. Once it off, there are two O-rings, one under the cartridge and one around the outer edge of the canister. The replacement unit comes with the two new O-rings and grease to lube the O-rings.

Once the new cartridge was installed in the air dryer base, I reversed the removal procedure.

I will tell you that this not a project for the faint of heart. It's a dirty project because the air dryer is in line with the rear u-joint and grease gets thrown on the air dryer. This job is not highly technical, just dirty with one hard to reach nut/bolt that holds the bracket to the frame.",Interior

All of a sudden the ""Pos-A-Loc"" feature on the front door is catching and preventing us from closing the door. If we only open the door partially, and then close it...it's okay. But if the door opens all the way, it locks up. It has been an ordeal to get it to close once this happens. (I'm afraid John is going to break it in the process.)

John is fairly handy, and is usually able to solve these problems. He says that previously he became aware that the ""Pos-A-Loc"" feature did not work at all. It was not a big issue, but the door did not remain in the open position as it should have. So now, the opposite is happening. It goes into the open mode and won't come out regardless of lifting either of the door handles.

Anyone else have this problem? Anyone know what we can do to fix it? An RV repair guy who happened to be in the park recently took a look and his advice was that it would have to go back to the manufacturer. I find this hard to believe!

This is a shot in the dark, but it's cheap and easy to do.

1. The male latch pin the door lock closes on should be able to move around in its' elongated slot. Grab hold of it and see if you can move the pin up/down or left/right (looking at the pin). If it is hard to move or does not move, I use a spray can of liquid wrench or similar product to loosen it up.

2. Good lubrication of the door lock is essential for continued operation. Using a spray can lubricant of your choice, spray the lubricant around the pivot points of the latch parts.

The AC condenser had to be replaced which is in the same general vicinity of the two doors. I don't know if there is any connection to the two events.
But shouldn't the doors manually unlock regardless of the low voltage Presently charging batteries with the generator

Can access to the electric cargo area be done from the other side of the coach? Can the locks be manually disabled from the outside without destroying the mechanism? ",Door Locks and Parts
I don’t have a Newmar but on Winnabego I sometimes have to push the cargo door in while pulling on the handle to get the cargo door to open even if I unlock it with the key. Sometimes they just stick. ,Door Locks and Parts
