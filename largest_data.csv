It ran well when we bought it but last year it started backfiring when you took your foot off the gas, and using twice as much gas. Ran awful so we parked it. Local mechanics took my money for tuneups but no improvement. Its a Ford 460
fuel injected engine so I went on the Ford 460
forum for a few months. Finally got an old guy who knew the engine. He said to replace the fuel pressure regulator
and idle control valve
. Presto! A wonderful sweet running engine.
It has a Ford chassis and we had the famous ignition key linkage break in the steering column
. This is identified when you go to start the engine, feel a snap when you turn the key, and the key now rotates completely around with no resistence. This requires pulling the steering wheel and tearing the column apart. Lots of tricks. This is common with Fords of this era so fotunately there are lots of excellent you tube videos.
The water heater leaked when we pressurized it this spring. I pulled it out but it was a rusty wreck, not repairable. Went through a long song and dance to find the right replacement but thanks to one knowledgeable RV tech we got one that works.

"Well after reading thru this thread I figured I needed to join in. Bought a 2008 Tour Master T40c in mid-June as a trade for our 2008 Hurricane 31H gasser. I really wished I had looked it over more carefully. :-(
Lots of little foibles to fix. The unit has 3 sets of batteries, 2 12v chassis, 2 12v house, and 4 6v house for the inverter stuff like a residential fridge. Dealer said the 4 6v ones were bad and was replacing them for us but didn't have any 6v on hand so put in 4 12v ones wired appropriately. Turns out those were not the house batteries that were bad. Moved 2 of them to the main house area to replace the 2 bad 12v ones there and buying 4 new 6v for the front this week like it should have. At least now the main house 12v works and I can operate lites and other stuff in it.
Door check strap was not working properly so I have that all apart trying to fabricate a fix for it.
Door keyless entry
was not functioning and I just found that it may be just a fuse. (not likely from my experience so far)
I have a ""water in fuel"" warning about 100 miles from the dealer driving it home, but there is no water coming out of the separator so I think either the sensor or filter in it may be bad.
While under the front dealing with batteries I noticed the inside of both front wheels are ""wet"" so I will be doing inner wheel bearing
seals very soon since I need to get it inspected which will also mean replacing brake shoes

Anode rod is shot and have new one coming today. Need to flush the HW
tank as well.
And, before we even use it, the wife wants to paint the walls, cabinets and put down new flooring so we have all the doors off and in the garage right now.

Congrats on your TourMaster coach. We had several in our Club and they had Mercedes engines which were very good and powerful engines. It seems like most of the stuff you have to fix are regular maintenance on any motor home
. Like the anodes, they need to be changed out every year. Fact I just done mine on a Suburban ten gallon tank. Got the part through Amazon for thirteen bucks (magnesium) type.
The painting of the cabinets is what is hard for me to imagine why so soon. I have the Walnut wood on mine and we just love it.
The battery thing is also hard to figure out why the dealer would replace six volt batteries with twelve volt batteries. It will work if hooked up properly, but the thing is that deep cycle six volt batteries are much better for the house part. Twelve volt for the chassis, cranking of the engine is just fine.
Best of luck with your new coach.",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know exactly what you are going thru as our last coach was a 2006 Georgie Boy Pursuit. The first day when were got home with our new to us MH the front driver side slide wouldn't go in, motor worked but no slide movement. Looking under the slide to see what was going on i saw other pieces of broken shear pins of various types. I used a bolt for the temporary fix. Thought okay this is probably why i got such a good deal as the previos owner wasn't as handy.
One of the broken pins looked like a roll pin which i couldnt find in any stores so i got a 1/4"" SS clevis pin. I bought several just in case. That broke again some time later. The second pin i put in i removed after the 6th use to see whats going on and it was bent and would soon break. I took a 1/4 drill bit to clean up where the pin went, put a new one in without having to use a hammer and punch and at the 6th slide use i just pushed the old one out with the new one. Only took a few minutes. I was concerned what would happen if the pin would break when the slide was almost in, that would be a very difficult repair.
It didn't take long to use up my supply of pins and started a search. I found a manufacture of quality SS pins at pivotpins.com. Only catch was their $35 minium order. I had a supply to last a lifetime. The 1/4 pins i bought had the small hole in the end where i put a cotter pin in so it wouldnt fall out. When we traded in that GB all i could pass along to the potential owner was the pins i had in the coach. Somewhere in my garage i will eventually find that bag of pins.
Over the 5 years of owning the GB every time we met another GB owner they would ask if i had a problem with the slide. I would say yes and tell them my work around. This was most likely an under engineered design subject to fail.",Exterior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"While on my trip (Seattle to HB, Ca.) I had a trans slip issue start up while on the last leg of the pass just south of Ashland, Oregon. After cresting the RV would not go beyond 30-35mph. Pull off at Yreka, Ca. stayed the night (Baxters Auto lot).
The next morning they sent me over to Onarheim truck repair. Mechanic checked what I had checked (fluid) which was perfect no issue. he also drove it without issue. Says it may have gotten hot.
Continue on south. Made it to HB, Ca. (shot over from the 5 to the 101 via 505 - 680 - 101). No issue.
On the return trip ~10 days later just south of Willits, Ca. (after a pass) I had it do the same thing again. This was after driving without issue from just north of San Louis Obisbo.
Same results next morning no issue. However roughly 35 later same issue popped up. This time I could tell the trans was in limp mode. Not going from 2-3. Quickly realizing that when turning of the engine and restarting it resets and all is ok. Now beginning to look like shift solenoid issue. Did this (3) until I reached Grants Pass, Oregon and stopped the night. Ended up staying just outside of Jerry's Clutch & Transmission (Great guy). While stopped I used paper clip to pull codes 68 and 87.
The following morning (Joe) mechanic used computer and pulled same codes:
68 - Trans slip
87 - Shift solenoid stuck open
He quickly fixed it by stating the 68 slip can be resolved by turning the force valve up 1/4 turn and we'll replace both shift solenoids A & B.
While we had the RV up on rack he also found that the trans wire connector was leaking as well. Replaced it with upgraded one. Back on the road in roughly 2-3 hours. $290
So if anyone ever has trans issue I highly recommend Jerry's clutch & transmission in Grants Pass, Or.",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I see, so no eternabond around the perimeter of the vent, correct?
I have a Thread linked below where I asked about this. Seems that many do Dicor, wait 24 hours then EternaBond tape around the vents but I'm not sure how they handled the vent hinge (front side of vent)...

I'm going to take more of the old Dicor off and clean then apply new Dicor today or tomorrow. Have the EternaBond tape and roller here but confused on the vent hinge.
I replaced a few of the rusty head screws with new SS #8 1"". Have one screw that doesn't want to seat all the way so probably will use a #8 3/4"" in that hole. Probably didn't need to replace them and maybe it wasn't wise.

I'm not familiar with your model coach but my coach is on a Gillig chassis and I bought the replacement switch assembly from Gillig. The part is made from a nylon plastic which I believe is true for all makes and model vehicles. The tab which returns the turn signal
lever to the neutral position after completing a left turn had broken and I would have to manually return the lever to the middle (off) position.
If you have a switch to turn off your air horns then turn them off first. The, remove the horn button
to expose the steering wheel bolts and the large center nut. My steering wheel is mounted with three allen head bolts. After removal of the steering wheel I removed the center nut which holds a backing plate in place. You will then need a steering wheel/hub pulling tool and three of the same thread sized bolts as the allen head bolts but longer. The tool can probably be bought at any auto parts
store and may, or may not, come with the bolts you will need. Before removing the hub use a Sharpie or similar to mark the position relative to the steering shaft so that your steering will be reinstalled in the same position at reassembly. You will then have access to the switch assembly. Disconnect and remove the assembly. The wires go down along the column. If your wires don't have a plug you have to cut and splice the new wires into place. if your coach doesn't already have a switch to turn off the air horns then this is a good opportunity to install one. Mine did not have a switch and more than once the horn was blown at a less than ideal time. (I blame my kids.) put everything back together and you should be good to go.

Who puts maint. free batteries in an RV?? I put an ounce of mineral oil in each cell of the new batteries to help prevent gassing off, it works! Then I changed oil and filter (full synthetic Amsoil) changed fuel filter
and installed shut off valves on the inlet and outlet side to make changing the fuel filter
easier in the future. Serviced the trans, new filters and Amsoil full synthetic as well. Changed rear end oil to you guessed it Amsoil 75-90 severe gear full synthetic, changed the oil in my front wheel bearings
to the Amsoil synthetic as well, then greased ""Everything"" with Amsoil grease.

The stealership where we bought it in Arizona tried to buff the road side to make it shine but all they did was cut down the clear coat over the stripes so now they are pealing. Then scrubbed the whole unit down and put about 10 coats of ZEP on it, I know a lot of people on here don't like ZEP but up here in Canada we don't have the intense sun like the southern states so it work just fine up here, I still plan on putting a good UV protecting wax on top of it to help protect it and then give it a few coats of ZEP every spring to stay ahead of it. for a 2004 coach it looks like new!

Mikonos,
Partner, this is not the thread for this but, I gotta tell ya Pal, from that second picture, it looks dangerously close to the point that your rear wheels/tires are very close to ALMOST no-contact with the ground. And, it's a down hill slope to the rear. If I had to guess, I'd say your coach was still not level even though you had your rear jacks extended quite a bit. At least that's the way I see things in that picture. However, pictures can be deceiving.
Bud, just for info and you and your significant other's safety here, I'd pack a couple of ramps, some blocks etc. so that in a condition like what I see there, you could drive up on to assist in leveling so that your jacks aren't over extended to get you to level. Just trying to help here. I'd hate to see you bend those things in that kind of a situation. That would not be a good thing. Good luck.

I donâ€™t mean to disagree with you but calcium buildup can and will lead to element failure. The calcium will cause corrosion to form between the metal casing around the heating element allowing pinholes to form. Water then gets into the insulator and grounds the element. After the element shorts inside the water heater it will cause the amperage to increase to the point it burns the wire terminals
. Calcium buildup can also damage the element by acting as an insulation around the outside of the element. This results in damage to the element and again my result in failure.",Heating and Cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the warning lights would suddenly come on and the coach would die. Now this is not good especially if you were on the interstate at 65 mph. The other warning that came on was a transmission communication error and the coach would die. Five visits and multiple phone calls to the local and South Carolina manufacturing site for Freightliner they finally figured out the Europe codes, the shift pad was shorting out and causing the coach to lose communication with the transmission and for some unknown reason kill the engine. So if you have a Palazzo and these issues come to light have them check the shift pad first and you might be able to avoid 8 months of not using your coach vs the fun of using it!

Hey Tim,
Well, at present, I think I have no less than about 20+ pairs of pliers in my tool box. 5-6 pairs of vise grips (some are burnt from holding close proximity joints for welding), some small (about 4"" long needle nosed vice trips and blunt nosed ones too), gas or regular pliers, BIG BERTHA or, otherwise known as the largest pair of channel lock type pliers made by Craftsman, cutters of all types and sizes, wire strippers of all types and sizes and specialty pliers for specific purposes. I've used vice grips for all my life. Yep, they have their place in the mechanical world but, usually not the first in line up of what to use.
As for penetrating oil, well, 65 now and, been been wrenching ever since I was oh, probably around 12 or so and, as of yet, I've NEVER, EVER had a penetrating oil work for me. I've tried pretty much everyone that's been made. I've soaked things for 3-4 days and, no luck. Some folks have had luck with penetrating oils but, not me. The most recent case for me was the infamous fan hub bearing replacement for our C-7 330 CAT. CAT, in it's infinite wisdom, decided that four, Allen head, flat head, metric 6MM or 7mm screws would hold the fan serpentine pulley onto the fan hub. Well, in order to get that fan hub off, you have to get those Allen head screws out.
Well, after quite a bit of time screwing around with every method known to man, trying to break them free, I said the hell with it and, hit them with something stronger than they were. A DRILL BIT! That did the trick. I had all four off, and the pulley, in about 2-3 minutes. Should have done that in the first place. Live and learn.
As for cutting blades for sawzalls etc., I've been using ""Lennox"" blades from Lowes. They are white in color and, without a doubt, some of the strongest blades and, long lasting blades, I've seen yet. I've used some that I should have worn out long before they did.

I assume you mean the washer.
Turns out it didn't need a pump anyway. In being removed from it's hole for the re-plumbing project(long story short, the coach froze and busted all the plumbing when my electric heater in the basement failed)the drain hose got pulled off the pump just enough to leak a bit. Re-positioned the hose and clamp and I think it's good.
Access required laying it on it's side and taking the bottom off. While it was out I had a drip tray fabricated so if it does leak again it won't get into the walls. Just about done with the trial load and not a drip of water in the pan.
I may actually have my entire list of maintenance for the winter completed(knock on wood).

In being removed from it's hole for the re-plumbing project(long story short, the coach froze and busted all the plumbing when my electric heater in the basement failed)the drain hose got pulled off the pump just enough to leak a bit. Re-positioned the hose and clamp and I think it's good.
Access required laying it on it's side and taking the bottom off. While it was out I had a drip tray fabricated so if it does leak again it won't get into the walls. Just about done with the trial load and not a drip of water in the pan.
I may actually have my entire list of maintenance for the winter completed(knock on wood).
How long are you going to be at the Mississippi State Park? We want to take about 3 or 4 weeks to get to Pensacola from here and I'm looking at places to stop in between.
I wish I was there now. Actually, that picture was taken last summer on our first trip there. Nice park, fairly small. Another nice little park is Tombigbee SP in MS. Its right on the edge of Tupelo. That would probably be on your way to FL.

I have all the stuff ready to go. My husband doesn't feel comfortable doing it by himself. If you ever watch Big Bang Theory he is Sheldon. Even the little quirks. Anyway... not the most practical mechanical sense. I drained 5qts out of a 1.3 liter engine cause he kept checking and filling the oil when it was off level in the garage. The floor angled sharply to a drain. He was quite puzzled as to how that could be a problem.
Anyway...off to my coach repair guy Bertha went to get the roof done. Fortunately he is awesome and is happy he doesn't have to round up the stuff instead of insisting they buy it and upcharge it. He is also going to work on the ABS issue I was going to work on, and get that darn wheel cover off the front wheel and pound it back into shape.
The good thing/bad thing the rear passenger brake was dragging on the way there. Nice to catch a problem in action and actually end up at the mechanic when you find out there is a problem. Bad thing is its just going to add to the bill.

What you've overlooked is the fact that the replacement cooling unit is an upgraded Arctic Air, (aka Amish) unit that is not under recall and has not caused any fires, not a Norcold replacement. The extinguisher is only for safety redundancy, if something highly unlikely should occur. I bought a Recreational Vehicle, not a rolling apartment that requires spewing so much carbon monoxide at my camping neighbors.

Mine sure was too. The reason the bearings were bad on my unit was because when they were pressed on the commutator shaft, the press pushed against the bearing race dust cover instead of against the inner ring of the bearing. I could see the square indents marked on the dust cover. These bearings are quite tight on the shaft and need to be pressed on carefully. If you don't have a press, and the right puller to pull them off, I'm sure a local machine shop could do the job in about 5 minutes.",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also was perfect for connections transferring all my surround sound speaker wires from the old Memorex unit to this one. It did not have an AM antenna connection, which I could care less about for running through the receiver. I had to get an HDMI cable
to replace the old 3-wire connection from TV to Receiver.
It sounds FANTASTIC! I used Heavy Duty velcro on the bottom to secure it firmly within the cabinet. Just have to be careful where that is placed on the bottom as there is airflow from the bottom of the unit to go up and out the top, so no velcro over the vent openings in the bottom.

A call to Winegard got an obnoxious technician who would only recite a canned script that said I had an out of date system that was out of production. When I asked if parts were available, she refused to answer and would only read the script. The bottom line was that I was to get the unit down from the roof, pay postage to send it to Winegard and then they would tell me if they even had parts to repair it. I had already disassembled it enough to know the elevation motor was the problem. That was the last straw with Winegard.
After a post on a few RV forums, I was directed to RF Mogul. A couple of calls got me the a WEB site and I ordered one. All parts are available to this antenna and servicing seems very easy and straight foward. I finished installing mine today and am very pleased.

This unit also has inputs for 2 wired side view cameras, and possibly an optional forward viewing wireless camera, although I can't find a part number for it. Overall the build quaility on the camera and monitor is better than the old no name brand ones I had.

That missing part of gasket will have gone out. That is on the exhaust side anyway.
Your compressor side probably was damaged long before the gasket went. It doesn't take much to do the damage it has. You will likely see a real improvement in power and economy after you replace the turbo.
I have seen damage like that many times from some little bits that got into the clean side of the intake system

Sorry for your radiator woes. We ran through a radiator problem with out 2001 Dutch Star. Radiator started leaking, limped to a Freightliner shop. They recommended NOT using the Freightliner radiator as they had a lot of problems with them. They recommended a local speed shop who built radiators from scratch, better built, better warranty, took a week to remove, take to shop, shop built radiator, reinstalled. That was three years and 25k miles ago. No issues since. Oh, and for history, the PO replaced the Freightliner radiator 5 (FIVE) times in 120k miles . . . One was road damage, installed wrong radiator and replaced it with correct one, no charge, that one was faulty radiator, failed after maybe 3 months, replaced, no charge, the other two were unexplained. So fingers crossed, hope this ""built"" one lasts as long as we have coach!",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe the output wire from it is purple and goes to a 1/4"" terminal on the ESI board. Check for 12 volt there. If it's zero volt, the thermal fuse is bad.
The printing on the fuse give enough info to google it. Amazon and eBay carry them. So do most electrical supply places. So do RV stores.

Air dryer cycling issues are almost never caused by the air dryer. Every time the compressor unloads the dryer purges. Find out why the system won't hold pressure and your cycling issue will be cured.
OTOH, rebuilding the dryer can't hurt anything.

I just went through this process. The first thing i would recommend is to air it up and listen, if you don't hear anything obvious i would look up the brake tests that should be done pre trip, it gives you a guideline as to how much pressure the system should lose doing standard tests. It will give you an idea if the brake chambers are the issue. Otherwise you need a good old bottle of soap water and start hunting. Its helpful to understand how the system works, i will not go into it here but you can find all this on the internet. there are relays front and rear that control the front and rear brakes.

I was a service manager and was lucky enough to go to the dealer show every year at Louisville. This show is not open to the public. It is for dealers only. All the representatives from the different manufacturers are there. This includes the tire manufacturers. ALL the manufacturers said there tires were good for ten years. Where does the 5 to 7 years come from? The tire dealers. They are wanting to sell more tires. I will go with the manufacturers recommendation every time.

"Fixed flletwood a/c control
irv2 and its contributors have been a valuable resource for people like me who own an older motor-home. In particular, I want to do a special thank you to Waiter21. Its people like him that make irv2 the valuable resource it's become.
I'm getting ready for a trip in a few weeks, but having problems with my A/C and furnace, They come on and run for no reason, and are totally unreliable. It got to the point where I was turning the circuit breakers on/off to run the units manually. I need to get this fixed before my trip
Searching through posts on irv2, this seemed to be a common problem with older Intellitec ECC control systems. Waiter21 chimed in and offered several things to get the system working, cleaning the switches and sliders, look carefully at the circuit boards for corrosion and bad solder joints especially where the connectors plugs are. He gave me his phone number and we talked on the phone. Everything looked ok, but when I tested it, there wasn't any change He suggested calling Intellitec, they may be able to repair my boards, and also check with Fleetwood, they may have some new boards in stock.
He then said he had one other option that I might be interested in. He does electronics and computers as a hobby, and had been working on a replacement for his Intellitec system. He had so much documantion that he put together a dedicated web site just for this (he does web sites as a hobby also). I wasn't expecting a lot but went there as a last resort just to see what he had done.
www.waiterecc.com
WOW - This is AWSOME
After talking to Intellitec and Fleetwood, I called Waiter21 about what it would take to get one of his systems. (his real name is John) He said he doesn't offer these for sale because he's still tweaking on it, and the market is so small its probably not a viable commercial product. He said he'd let me have one at cost, but I needed to review all the installation, operation, and technical stuff on the web site, install and operate it, then report back any problems or suggestions for improvement. He called it BETA testing.
He sent me a system, circuit board, operator panel, temperature sensor, and some custom wire bundles. It took about 2 hours to install everything. When I turned it on, IT WORKED.. I followed his recommendation to do a calibration of the original temperature sensors, they were within 1 degree.
As I operated the system over the next few days, I had two questions for him. The AUTO COOL seemed to operate a little differently than the original Intellitec. (I like the new way). He said several others had suggested changeing how the blower operates in AUTO. Everyone likes the new process, when A/C reches the set point, blower turns off about 30 seconds after the compressor turns off.
The other big one for me was the temperature display. I live in Canada and we do things the correct way, in Celsius. When I called him, he said â€œDARN, I never even thought of thatâ€. That afternoon, he calls me back and says to check my email. He had made a change to the software so you can configure it to either display in F or C. He then walked me through how to upload this change to my system.
This whole experience has been absolute awesome, If it hadn't been for irv2 and Waiter21, I probably would have spent a thousand dollars to fix the old system. Instead, I now have a modern system that has all kinds of neat features, at a small fraction of the cost. Again, Thank you Waiter21, you have some really neat hobbies.
If you're having problems with your Intellitec system, and it looks like its not repairable, take a look at what Waiter21 has put together. Visit his web site and check out his system. Contact him and see what it would take to get one of these for you motor-home. www.waiterecc.com",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well gang,
I noticed a few drops of pink type fluid on my RV garage floor so I got under it to check out just what it was. It could have been tranny fluid or coolant. It was coolant. A loose radiator hose
clamp for a radiator lower hose was that culprit. But, while under there I noticed the water pump belt was quite loose on our CAT C-7 330HP. Well it was a major operation to do what was needed to be done. I had to yank the radiator, air intake
tube, and slide out the basement A/C 3/4 of the way.
All of that was needed to gain access to the fastening bolts/screws etc. that retain the radiator and CAC in our '04 Itasca Horizon 36GD. I had to yank the radiator simply because, I could not get to ONE BOLT that is used to secure the water pump belt tensioner so I could tighten the water pump belt. When I finally got to it, I found the tensioner was very rough in rotation so, I removed it and installed new bearings. While in there, I installed new bearings in both my serpentine belt tensioner and the serpentine belt idler.
And, might as well install some new belts while in there too. Once that was all back together, I dove into removing the S-cam rollers on my front brakes and clean and lube all that stuff up. I re-adjusted the slack adjusters, took it all out for a test drive and, no leaks in the rear of the coach, no clunk in the brake application and, all is well. Man these things are a pain in the A...
But, hopefully, I'm good for quite a while and can use it with confidence that important stuff is taken care of.

"We lost our satellite reception a year ago. Last June, our dealer replaced the receiver with a Wally and the dome antenna with a Playmaker. They could not get it to lock on to the satellite's. We needed the coach for a trip and we do not watch TV much on the road, so we let it go. They tried again in Sept before we left for the south, but still no cigar. After several attempts on my own, I finally have reception, but still confused. It turned out that both coax cables from the playmaker (Tiffin had a spare cable) would carry 13.25 volts to the antenna, but would not carry a signal back to the receiver. The HDMI powered splitter was also bad. I finally have a perfect picture with sound by running an external coax from antenna through the gap of a bedroom slide into the receiver and using the powered HDMI splitter that was intended for Traveler Sat antenna which we do not have. I am at a a loss as to how or why both OEM coax cables and the HDMI splitter could be bad. I tried eliminating different combinations of each component, but could not single out just one of them. Now, the simplest permanent solution is to run the new coax down next to the middle AC unit

"Well, yesterday when attempting to replace my air pressure spin on filter, it wouldn't budge using my strap wrench. Then for trying to slip my metal big over the cannister, it's jammed tight against the air hoses. Sooooooo, now for removing and putting spacers behind the bolts, which entailed doing the same for a little piece next to it, connected by a plastic hose that's barely long enough. All it takes is a little slack on this stuff instead of stretching everything so tight. Not blaming it on engineers with bean counters following them around, however.
Anyway, my filter wrench
easily slipped over it now and for easily coming loose.
By the way and for those doing so, don't forget to bleed all the air out or you might not ever break it free. Mine has an air valve on the line next to it, but you may have to bleed the tanks with the lanyards' or for crawling down under to do so.",Chassis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sounds like I am not the only one with cable issues. We have not been able to get cable to work at any RV parks, but have only been to about 7 or so since we bought our '21 Cornerstone. Since the dealer, MHSRV in Texas, said they couldn't do it for a couple of weeks when we BOUGHT the coach, we figured we would wait and take care of it later. Well, later has arrived. I contacted DISH and DTV, and since we don't have either one at our home, the quote is $177 a month for MOST of the channels we actually want. Hmmm, for part timers, not sure that sounds quite right. Then I meet a nice couple in Naples that said they plug in a device like an Apple TV box, and they are tied to their home account and it doesn't cost them anything. ?? I call Apple, as we have multiple Apple boxes at home, and they said they don't know anything about RV's. I call the closest Entegra dealer, and they say to order the receiver and set up the plan we want, then bring it to them and they will sort it out for me. I just can't quite seem to get my arms around the simple facts. I have a Winegard satellite on the roof already, so it should be simple, but beyond my expertise. And no one I have talked with knows how to get in motion satellite/wi-fi, so I am hoping the dealer can do it.
The only thing I fixed my myself lately is my drawer under the entry steps that would keep popping open on all my LH turns. Dealer said they fixed it, but on the first corner leaving the dealership, the drawer slammed into the entry door again. So when I got home, I figured out how to remove the drawer, then discovered there was a screw missing inside that held the back of the drawer in position with a magnet holding the drawer shut. After shimming up with an additional magnet, the problem was solved.
Now, if I can just learn all the tech-y stuff",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Departing Gulf Shores, Alabama, last week I heard a flapping noise under the engine cover. I removed the cover and found the engine serpentine belt was disintegrating . The spare belt was folded tightly and didn't want to spread out to fit the many pulleys so after several unsuccessful attempts I ended up using tape to hold it on the alternator and A/C compressor pulleys while I crawled underneath to connect everything else. The Chevy 8.1 engine has the belt tensioner underneath, and a 3/8 breaker bar
is used to rotate it to release the belt tension. It's very handy to have a small ratchet strap to hold the breaker bar
in position while attaching the serpentine belt. Also, a pair of needle nose pliers
to remove remains of the belt that had wrapped around the fan hub. The good news is that I caught this in time to pull into a shopping center for replacement rather than having a complete failure on the interstate highway",Heating and Cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My Norcold was working perfect, but while at a resort in San Diego we were getting ready to go out and I happen to notice no lights or power coming into the refrigerator. What happened the heat sensor turned it off. So I decided to call a repairman from Elite RV in SD. He told me right away what the problem was. So I asked if he could replace the cooling unit coils on the back and he said yes. So he did not use Norcold, he used another company that gave more warranty. It is heavy duty like the Amish. Total was $2500.00 parts and labor and taxes. The repair turned out perfect. The two freezer temperature is zero and the fridge I like it at 34 degrees. But I really can not complain on the original Norcold 1200, it lasted seventeen years, plus they had given me back on the recall law suit $1200.00.

I'm also working on many small leaks, replacing the refrigerator cooling unit, and plan to replace the brake master cyl. and hydroboost unit, possibly the rear brakes, and at least four tires. The tires have lots of tread but are weather cracked. I will also replace the outer skylight over the shower and install a better shower enclosure. The awning will also need some attention where the sun has damaged it at the top by the roller. Of course all lubricants will be changed, the chassis greased, and the front end has been aligned. I also have a backup camera to install so we can watch the toad. After that I think it will be ready for our upcoming 8k mile summer trip.

what type of roof were you painting?
what we're your criteria in selecting your paint / material?
the reason i'm asking is because i'd like to remove the unnecessary parts from our roof, dicor / eternabond and waterproof as best as possible. i've been leaning toward henry tropicool as the seal but am interested in hearing about your decision process.

Also repaired a leak in the fresh water tank. The tank had a very slow leak that had over time rotted out the floor of its compartment. Completely dismantled and rebuilt the compartment floor then set about trying to find a replacement tank.
The old tank was 100 gal. Elkhart Plastics product. A few hours of internet searching and numerous phone calls led me to the conclusion that an exact replacement was not to be found and the closest substitute which fit in the compartment had a capacity of only 83 gal. Even that cost more than $500 not including $200 or so shipping.
I decided it would be worthwhile to see if the tank could e repaired by plastic welding. Turns out my tank - and most rv fresh water tanks - are made of polyethylene, which is a thermoplastic.
Although I had no experience welding plastic, a few YouTube videos and I'm ready to give it a try. A hot air plastic welder is available at Harbor Freight fairly cheap.
It took a little practice and some problem solving but the repair was successful - at least with a static pressure test. Won't know for sure until I head out next month but I'm cautiously optimistic.

1. Installed a couple of battery cut off switches because we rent a storage unit that doesn't have power.
2. Changed rear diff oil to Lucas Synthetic gear oil. The old oil didn't look too bad but I'm pretty sure it hasn't seen the outside world since it was installed at the factory in 1998.
3. Replaced halogen lights over the couch with LEDs. Excellent light, lower power draw, and the upper part that projects into the upper cabinets doesn't get hot - just warm. I was able to keep the factory bezel and tilt the led internals so my wife can sit on the couch and read a book.
4. Built a fan unit for the fridge that replaces the factory light. It is a 4"" wide by 1"" tall aluminum U channel with holes drilled on the side facing the fins. An 80mm computer at one end blows up into the channel and the air comes out the holes and washes over the fins and down. I used led strip lighting left over from my interior light conversion, and mounted it full length on the channel. The fan is wired to run whenever the fridge is on, and the led strip is wired to the origonal light connection. It provides awesome lighting when you open the door and helps circulate the interior air. Fancy-schmancy!
5. Installed a ceramic desktop Zebra head nighlight - that my wife found in Target a couple weeks ago - on the toilet room window vallance frame, in one corner. Provides a soft glow for those middle of the night bathroom trips , it's cute, and goes with other ""Safari"" themed decorations in our Safari Serengeti.
6. Speaking of Safari themed decorations. Since we purchsed the rig a year and a half ago, we have slowly accumulated a collection of plastic African animals - and some stuffed ones. My wife thought it would be fun to cut the heads off the plastic animals and ""mount"" them in various places throughout the coach. Just this week we found a girraffe and his head is now mounted near the clock in the kitchen area. He joins a zebra and another girraffe who are in the bathroom on the shower frame, and a tiger ( I know, tigers are from India) who's head is a drawer pull on a nightstand.

Do you have a Cummins diesel?
From a Cummins email:
""There was a gradual shift from J1708 to J1939 between 2004 and 2007. Any engines prior to 2004 are most likely to be exclusively J1708. Engines from 2004 â€“ 2007 are likely to have both protocols available. After 2007 itâ€™s most likely going to be J1939 (with the odd exception). The ISX has been around for some time, so check the engine manufacture date to get a better idea of the communication protocol, rather than the engine model.""
The OBDII dongle and the Cummins fault app only supports J1939. So, it's doubtful that it will work on your 1999.
I am currently building a scan tool for J1708. Uses the ELM325 chipset. (not the 327 which supports J1939).

bulbs so I will be able to see better, dam are they bright! I also installed 2 new electronic programmable thermostats to keep the heat in the coach a bit more comfortable.

"Well gang,
It's what I've done or repaired lately, this is a major job and, got more involved than I thought it would. No biggie. The coach is an '04 Itasca Horizon 36GD with the C-7 330HP CAT. Many of you know of the infamous ""fan hub bearing"" and it's potential for self destruction due to it being non-lubable. So, with 81K miles on it, it's time for replacement. Well, it just so happens that the water pump decided it was time to retire too so, that's getting replaced too. Along with all that is, new belts, new hoses, thermostat(s) (Caterpillar labels them as ""Regulators), some hose clamps and whatever else I think needs attention in that ""tough to get to"" motor compartment before I button it all up.
Here's a pic or two of it's present status. Not pretty.

"Are we ever really finished with a vehicle project/upgrade?
Be it our vintage cars
or our MH, can not honestly say they are ever really finished.
Had the corner weights measured on our 1996 Fleetwood Flair (P30 chassis), which had sagging front springs.
Seems 4,300 lbs. springs and air bags will still sag after 20 years. LOL
- Currency, replacing the sagging front springs with Super Steer springs.
Nice people by the way, at Super Steer. The sales man made sure to match the springs he was sending me to my actual coach front axle 4,800 pound weight.
- Just got new belts and hoses, from Rockauto today. 22 years and 29,000 miles. Time to change them!
- Brake hoses, caliper rebuild kits and carbon metallic pads (from Super Steer). JF9 4-wheel hydraulic disk brake system.
Was a real pain getting the correct MH brake hoses.
- Just ordered Hella H4 4x6"" headlights, from Summit Racing, to replace the original halogens. The factory halogens have a worse beam pattern than my 1980 Buick Regal had. Good luck seeing that deer crossing the road at night.

So.. people here have given me a ton of direction and advice....thanks!!!!!
1. Insulated my water lines and installed shop lights in the basement for light and heat.
2. Wired my printer to work on my front dashboard so the passenger seat table is now my office.
3. Cleaned and lubed my slide-out rails to reduce the risk of slide-a-phobia (OMG it does not work!).
4. Removed, lubed and re-installed the curtain on my screen door which stopped going up. Now it races up and ""bangs"" as it did when we got the coach.
5. Removed the worthless vent fan that stopped working, now looking at the alternatives for replacement and will install when that is decided.
6. Replaced all light bulbs with 5K LED's and ""let there be light"" is heard and seen all over the coach.
7. Put sea foam in the fuel tank
as we are sitting for 4 months.
8. Installed hooks on the curtain fascia's in the bedroom using 1"" blocks to hold the hooks behind the cheap press board used to construct them. Use the hooks for hanging garments when they dry..... (have washer no dryer).
On the list: (looking for advice where it can be had)
1. The vent fan
2. Build a shelf behind the sofa at window height for more storage
3. Build a clothes rack (hanging) on the side of the bed for more girl storage
4. Replace windshield wipers
5. Water the batteries (4 6V & 1 12V)
6. Start the de-oxidation and cleaning to prepare for Zep-ping the gel coat...

"The water pump on my 2000 Monaco Windsor
stopped working.
There is no wiring diagrams from Monaco (REV)
The system works this way; the coach has three switches that send a signal to a module, the module sends battery voltage to the pump.
Here is ""my"" problem and the problem of many others Windsor's owners that probably have the same setup.
Monaco, back when, decided to install a ""Radio Controller"" made by Intellitec to provide battery voltage to the pump. This module is rated for a 3 amp draw.
Why it lasted that long is beyond me, maybe because I didn't use the water pump that much in all these years.
So I bought a Water pump controller that is actually cheaper than the Radio controller and it is rated a 10 amp.
The problem is that the controller does NOT send battery voltage to the pump, it sends ground. So the fix is to install a relay that will switch voltage.
Intellitec will provide the ""WRONG"" diagram. The repair is very simple.
You need some wires, a few connectors, and a relay. If interested send me a private message and I can send a diagram and pictures of the location.

"Last week I installed a new air filter on our 400ISL engine.
Then, I recently decided to put a new backup camera on our coach because the old, obsolete camera system was old and obsolete. Time to start.
I didn't want to use a wireless camera because of radio frequency issues with our TPMS and video quality, I wanted to keep the Trip-Tec output on the backup camera video display, wanted to use a new video monitor and the cable for the old backup camera could not be cheaply/easily used for another camera system, so I got a new camera that connects to the new monitor with a RCA video cable. This meant connecting the new monitor at the front of the coach to the new camera on the back of the coach with new video and 12v cables.
I figured if I was already running a video cable and 12v power 40' away through the coach and was going near the bedroom TV, I may as well fish new HDMI, network and a RG6 coax cables at the same time for an updated entertainment system.
I ran the cables from the front upper entertainment cabinet above the driver's seat to a boxed in valence over the front side window, up above the ceiling, then into the air conditioning ceiling duct in the front of the coach, out of the duct in the bedroom, then above the ceiling and down into the bedroom TV cabinet, through the bedroom closet and out through the engine compartment to the backup camera.

Swapped out original Norcold 1200 for a Fisher Paykel residential unit.
Dewinterized and tested our Splendide Wash/dryer and noticed it didn't dry and smelled like hot electrical. Pulled it out, removed the top and found the cooling fan
for the blower motor
was rubbing on a nearby wiring harness
. This prevented the blower from working which allowed the heating coils to get very hot - hence the smell. The wiring harness
insulation wasn't damaged fortunately so I gave it a few wraps of electrical tape for future protection, cut the zip ties holding it in place, repositioned it away from the fan blades, and resecured it.

"Was forecast to get into the twenties last week so I decided to go out an get the motorhome ready for the cold weather. Drained the water lines, water heater, and placed a 100 watt incandescent bulb in the wet bay. I also like setting the temp on the furnace stat to 35 degrees in case it get's really cold.
Figured I'd better check its operation and found that the burner would not ignite. Blower came on, could hear the relay click, could smell propane, but no flame. Went ahead and pulled the furnace and did a quick look over. Found some dirt dobber nests inside the burner tube and blower assemblies so thought that maybe these could cause enough air blockage to keep ignition from occurring? Reinstalled, tried, still no go.
Pulled the whole unit again and this time set it on a bench so I could take things apart. A 5/8 inch crowfoot wrench was needed to remove the gas piping off the burner assembly. Got that off so I could see the igniter, then hooked to a battery, and hit the switch. Held the two blue stat wires together and ended up with a nice blue spark in the correct spot against the burner. OK,, so what was the problem?
Went back inside the house and did some more internet searching. One thing I came across was that the burner orifice could be partially plugged. I smelled gas so didn't really think that was it but gave it a quick cleaning anyway. Did seem to get a speck or two out of it so felt like I might have accomplished something.

That would have been allot more work to run coax and glad i didn't have to.
Today i undertook putting an 110v outlet in that cabinet. Why Thor didn't my guess would be to save a few pennies. They did at least have the cabinet cutout covered up with material so all i needed for that part was to cut an X in the material. Had to remove the A pillar plastic cover and fish tape down to another 110v supply. Getting to that one zip tie on a bundle of wires to cut proved most challenging.

"Well,
For those of you that may need replacement mud flaps
, the ones behind the duals, not the long-full length one, I just did it today. For the life of me, I could not find them in the Winne parts catalog. So, I called a few auto parts
stores in my area. Napa was the winner here. They had several different flaps I could choose from.
I ended up choosing the cheapest ones they had. They are good quality rubber and are, 24"" x 24"" and don't have any logo or name on them. They are about 1/4"" thick with some ribbing here and there for structural strength.
But, my flaps ( maybe as well as many of yours out there in RV land) are only 23.5"" wide by 12"" long. So, I could have purchased one single flap and cut two out of it. But, based on the design of them, I would have ended up with one that had rounded corners at the bottom and one with square corners, not good.
So, for a measly $26 for the two of them total, I got two. I cut the bottom half to be used for the flaps. The reason I used the bottom half is because the corners were already rounded. I had gasket hole punches from Harbor Freight already so, punching those holes in that rubber, was a piece of cake.
It's all done and, they look great. So, if anyone has some sad looking mud flaps
or, they're completely gone or aged, check your local Napa store.",Exterior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My water heater was completely loaded with calcium buildup but the wiring was unaffected so I'm not sure if that could cause the wires to get hot. I also spent several hours cleaning out the deposits which were caked to the tank lining below the heating element.

If I were to display all I've done on our coach, an '04 Itasca Horizon 36GD with the C-7 330HP CAT, either lately, or, since the day we purchased it, I'd take up another 15 or 20 pages. We love this coach and all about it. But, it is truly amazing on what I have had to do, in terms of repair on it. I have a spread sheet created by Excell and, even I'm amazed at what I've done. The most recent repair was installing a new water tank/city water diversion valve in the water compartment.
And that caused me to have to drain the water tank so I wouldn't keep getting rained on while in there for repairs. Well, when I went to fill the tank, drip, drip, drip, etc. at a fairly rapid pace, from the bottom of the coach. CRAP, now what? Well, it turned out to be the water tank drain valve. Since it had never been used, when I used it to drain the water, it apparently developed a bad seal. So, I had to dive into that one. $12.00 later and, about 2 hours labor, all done, new valve.

"Two weeks ago we drove from SW Michigan to Gulf Shores Alabama. The cruise started acting up right away. Would kick off when we hit a bump.

It was the brake fluid pressure switch so I thought it might be the same thing. Got to Gulf Shores and did a bunch of research. Found the part number. Had to order it from a local Ford dealer as no one else had it. $42 and a day later had it in my hand. R&R'd it at the campground.

Don't know if you got it fixed but the problem is likely to be melted actuators. They are car door lock actuators
. They have a plastic case. If the relay that supplies 12vdc sticks, 12vdc is applied continuously. This causes the actuator
to overheat and the housing melts .... then the actuator is stuck. Typically multiple actuators will get stuck at the same time. Try every door ... you may find 1 you can unlock with the key. This is NOT a good problem to have. If you can get 1 hatch open you may be able to get into the other bays by crawling thru. Fixing the problem depends on the RV make/model/yr..

Just as we arrived at our first destination (and about 4 hours of use) as we pulled up, jut stopped. Seemed to work ok for the rest of the trip. A few days ago, was exercising the gen, and running the rear air, and about 10 minutes in, same thing, just stopped. Gen has almost 350 hours on it. Getting into the range when they go.
After a bit of research, this is characteristic of a bad fuel pump/filter. Bought a replacement from Amazon, about 60 bucks for both, and plan on replacing next weekend. Only have about 30 ours on the oil from last use, so I think I am ok there. Maybe change plugs too.
Also did a trans service. Dropped the pan and replaced the filter and put in new. Didn't flush, but the fluid and pan looked really good, so I feel good about it.
Fixed my bathroom fart fan and skylight, and my fantastic vent (the switch was bad).

I ask him if he knows there is antifreeze out there now that is different colors that works in all systems. He says yes but insists it is wrong and has to be flushed.

Now, to be fair to the tech - he could have been right.
DexCool is an OAT style coolant, and it doesn't mix well with others - including some of the newer OAT (purple) formulations. If it inadvertently gets mixed with the standard glycol coolants with silica aditives you will have a mess that resembles mud. It will form globules that tend to block smaller passages. DexCool is an OAT coolant. I would never mix one of the ""Universal"" coolants with it. Those that are advertised as ""universal"" do not meet all of the DexCool specifications. You can buy DexCool compliant coolants from Prestone and Zerex. Even Peak branded coolant, which really pushes their ""universal"" coolant offers a DexCool specific product. For those of us with HOAT coolants in our vehicles, it looks like the Zerex G05 is the only coolant meeting all of those specifications. Like before, you don't want to mix OAT and HOAT coolants. Anyone adding a universal coolant to an HOAT system will be introducing additive packages that will break down the original fill and cause problems.
I have worked on vehicles that have had issues from the wrong coolant being added. Gone are the days of just grabbing a jug of the green stuff and filling your vehicle radiator. Of course, also gone are the days of annual coolant flushes and refills.....
I am always very careful when it comes to adding coolant to a vehicle. I check the owner's manual to ensure that the proper type is used. The same goes for automatic transmission fluid

Well I had the truck for 6 more years and never had a problem. It's an universal coolant meaning it can be used in any cooling system. Sure, don't mix specific kinds as that will not work out.

Another good reason would be to alleviate the situation we found ourselves in on the way back to OR after picking up our ""new to us"" Monaco in Mesa, AZ.
The alternator failed somewhere before Beatty, NV and just past Beatty the 3060 Allison stopped working.

I don't know about others, but I would certainly agree. I lost a perfectly good battery years ago by having a failed battery in the circuit and overcharging the good one. Perhaps there are gadgets to keep that from happening now, I don't know.
My reference to ""jumping"" the chassis batt. to coach batts. was a means of using the generator to replace a failed alternator to charge the chassis batt. The Cummins engine
seemed perfectly happy with a lack of electrical power, but not so the 3060 Allison. We were ""dead in the water"" until we jumped the batts. and run the gen the remaining 800 miles home.

Removed the bed and framing to gain access. With the tank out, all the associated plumbing and the problem pump I was able to dry out the wood out with heaters. Couple of soft spots but for the most part the shelf was sound. Sealed the OSB with penetrating epoxy, replaced the pump with a better model and rework the plumbing adding soft flexible tubing to help quiet the pump. Reworked the framing for the bed, side shelves along with insulating and draft sealing the entire area.
The epoxy worked out really well. Very thin and penetrated the OSB eliminating the soft spots and preventing further water damage should the tank or plumbing ever leak again.

The gasket in your pictures is the exhaust manifold
to turbo gasket. Intake side of exhaust housing if you like, but still the exhaust side. It's the exhaust pressure that spins the compressor wheel to build boost.
Your compressor wheel is the damaged one. Something got into the intake piping and did that damage. I have seen it many, many times when I worked on trucks.

"2004 MADP: My weekend project was to make it easier for DW to use the coach's dash stereo. She gets up early and likes to listen to the radio while getting ready for the day.

Now she can flip the switch up and the radio is fed 12v battery
power, flip it back down and the radio is fed switched ignition power like normal. Makes it easy to use the stereo while parked without turning on the key. A simple and useful project.
As long as I had the dash apart, I repurposed the old ""Nav System"" dash toggle that controlled the GPS in the old dash stereo I ripped out about a year ago. Now it switches 12v battery

So I had shut off my Batteries by pressing the battery disconnect switches. I thought I had turned them back on but a few days later I found my RV was no crank, no start, barely any battery juice, no aux at all.

There was alot of corrosion so the maintenance I did was to thoroughly clean the battery posts and the cables.
I used contact cleaner and a brush to remove the corrosion from the cable terminals and the posts. Worked very well. Then I applied CPC to all exposed metal to help slow new corrosion until I replace the battery. Also used electrical tape on the cable insulation to help protect them as they had some nicks here and there.
Cleaned & CPC'd all the hardware for the cables and reinstalled them nice and snug.

Thanks
The original problem I was having was due to voltage drop at the ignition lead to the isolation delay relay, the blue wire on the relay needs to see 13.3 v for 12 sec before it closes the tombreta relay tying the chassis and house batteries together which allows the alternator to charge the house batteries. Due to drop on the ignition lead that is connected to the blue wire on the isolation relay the voltage never got above 12.9 v which would never allow the batteries to charge so I used the voltage at the chassis battery post in the front distribution panel and switched it on using a relay powered by the ignition lead , I drew a sketch that I am attaching the drawing does not show it but I added a 5 amp fuse in the chassis battery lead before the relay contact if you have any questions let me know.",Electrical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If HWH their website is very helpful as are their tech reps via phone. Springs are pretty reasonable $ and not hard to do if you have a safe way to get clearance under the rig.
Wooden wedges placed between coils of an extended spring and retract the cylinder is a helpful trick for removal.
Reverse for replacement... clamp one end hook in a vise and insert wedges as you bend the other end from side to side extending the spring. Install on a fully retracted cylinder and then e tend to remove wedges.

If it's a roller shade, there's a slim chance it's repairable. Over the years at our shop, I tried to repair them many, many, times. The first challenge is being able to access the spring assembly. On both metal and wood rollers, there's usually a small brad or rivet securing the end. These will have to be removed before you try to pry the end cap off to access the spring. The other end is just a cap with a pivot and doesn't need to be removed. Beware, if the spring is still wound, there can be considerable tension on it. Wear eye protection. The vast majority of the time when the spring pressure goes it's because the spring itself has broken. If the break is near one end, you can sometimes remove the short broken piece and re-anchor the end, then re-tension, and reinstall. Did you hear anything let go when you tried to raise it? If not, it might be the dogging mechanism is jammed. Repairs to this are also rare because of this is where all the wear takes place and the hole can get elongated or worn or the dogging cam shaft worn. However the most common symptom of a failing dog, is the shade won't stay down. Usually when we got a work order to repair a roller shade or projector screen
, I'd suggest it be replaced because being able to make an effective repair is so unlikely. Now, of course, if this was my shade, I'd be taking it down to look just because I always like to see if I could fix it. But that's me.",Chassis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before you replace the mirror look it over there are hex set screws

"Looking to replace the beam type wiper blades on my 2021 Winnebago Adventurer 27N with either conventional or hybrid. The wiper arms have J-hook ends and the blade length is 800mm(32"").

The J-hook on the wiper arms measure 8.5 mm wide, the space inside the hook is about 10.5 mm and the length of the hook is about 32 mm.

I have no idea how to size this when shopping for blades. Google searches are vague at best. These forums mention blades for lot of different coach builders, which use different sizes. I ordered Trico 67-324 from Amazon (because they state they are for RV's) and the hook is sloppy on the blade mount; the width of the slot on the blade is much larger than the arm hook and there is too much play on the inside (10.5mm) hook clearance. There are no adapters included with these blades.

The Winnebago manual has no mention of wipers. I called Winnebago Customer Care, and they told me they have no idea what size the wiper arms accept, but I could buy replacements by calling Mobility RV. I do not want replacements; the beam type blades do not make good contact with the windshield at the tips.

The box shows a pass thru rivet for the plastic part that connects to J-Hooks. And, it shows a second hole, with the box direction showing the bolt attachment like I have on our coach. BUT NO HOLE for the bolt, on the actual wiper!

Sure, if I was home I could drill a hole. Or more likely pop-out the pass thru rivet and use those holes.

At first I thought Tricor had missed the drilling the hole, THAT THEY SHOW the picture of with the bolt/nut attachment. So opened the second box, and same thing...

I do carry tools, and I do have a Dremel on board. But, drilling and grinding off a rivet - will certainly mar/scratch the paint. And yes, I can go buy a can of spray paint and touch that up...

But you know, it just does not seem right! As we have rain to contend with, and one of the passenger wipers blade is now falling a part - I moved the rubber insert from Tricor to the AM wiper... But want the new wiper bow, as they're new, and the I believe they will keep the rubber blade in better contact with the windshield.

Two steps forward, one back! And just venting, and sharing that in this Tricor 67-284 RV wiper - the boxes images/directions are not representative of the actual blade!

No way would an American motorhome manufacturer include such a system on an entry level motorhomes. Maybe on the Prevost -type coaches?

From what I'm gathering, the Magic Vision Control wipers are a patented design that Mercedes first started using in 2017 on their higher-end cars. They are standard on their new Citaro bus (HERE) but, again, it's a higher-end transit bus with the latest features.

The washer system is on the blade itself but the entire wiper assembly is integrated. According to the article below, for cars, the entire assembly (blade and arm) has to be replaced if something is get broken or worn out ...not able to just change the blade itself evidently??

That's why it's probably, at this time, only for those who, one, can afford a Mercedes in the first place, and then the luxury of having the money to burn to replace it when it wears out and I suspect maybe a thousand dollars or more when the blades need replacing on a bus (???). It must be noted that there's a heating element integrated in the blade assembly too adding to the cost.

It didn't bust any lines or fitting. After that I will not depend on blowing out the lines.

"Based on current temps, I assume you have already winterized. But, here is my 2 cents. I have mine in an enclosed storage in the Galveston area. It is currently mid 20's outside right now. Admittedly this is nothing compared to what people north of us are seeing (like you in OK). I blew the lines out and poured the RV antifreeze in the drains and Splendide washer/dryer (spin cycle per manual). I drained my Truma water heater.

But, my plan next year is to go ahead and do a final sweep of the lines with antifreeze. It doesn't take that long, and I'd have a better peace of mind. If I lived up in OK, even with an enclosed storage (unless it is insulated), I would definitely use antifreeze. As others have said and as others have lined me out in the past on this forum, the air just doesn't do an awesome sweep. A good test is to sweep it with air then come back a few minutes later and see that more water comes out. You can keep doing that or just use antifreeze and be done. If only using air, unswept water will settle in low points and possibly freeze a fitting or maybe a valve and could cause damage. Yes, as someone else pointed out, be careful to use your user manual for your Oasis for special instructions. I've seen several people on this forum post about not winterizing their Truma Aqua Go water heater per the manual, and it cost them big time for something that is very easy to winterize. ",Winterizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What does your owner's manual say? Do that and don't worry.

But here are likely incomplete instructions:

Since you have an Oasis, you will need to pump RV antifreeze through the system. It will displace all the water. No need to blow out with air first (which requires filtration for the air or a oil-less compressor). Get full-strength red fluid out of every tap, hot and cold. Make sure it's enough to fill the drain traps, too. Don't forget the shower and outside shower. You might have a 3-way valve to make this easy or you might need to take the inlet off the water pump and use an adapter to connect the hose to the RV antifreeze containers.

If you have a washer or washer/dryer, a dishwasher, or an icemaker (or any combination) you will need to follow the instructions for each appliance. Compressed air won't winterize those lines, either.

Make sure all the tanks and low point drains are empty. If you have a black water tank flush, use that too. It helps to tilt the coach to the left a bit.

I use 5-6 gallons of RV antifreeze a year. Your coach might need 3, or 7, but you'll need more than one and fewer than 10. If you get 8 you'll probably have a head start on next year's supply.

Hope these ramblings are helpful.

(Edit) It appears that for at least some Oasis models, you can use the fresh water drain and optionally compressed air to winterize the unit *or* use RV antifreeze. See https://www.manualslib.com/manual/12...S.html?page=11 Find and use the manual for yours, though, to be sure. ",Winterizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Search is always a good idea, but the manuals are often a better source for information about winterization procedures. Also, the OP has an Oasis. Similar but not the same, so the procedures might differ.

For AH, though, from the 450DE Service Manual on p. 112:

""Please follow these instructions when winterizing the Aqua-Hot’s Domestic Water Heating System; reference Figure F1:
1. Completely drain the fresh water storage tank.
2. Disconnect the domestic water demand pump’s suction line from the fresh water storage tank.
3. Attach an adequate piece of hose onto the suction side of the domestic water demand pump.
4. Place the opposite end of the hose into an adequate supply of FDA-approved “GRAS” RV Antifreeze, and turn on the demand water pump.
Open and close all interior and exterior water faucets, one at a time, until only pure RV Antifreeze is present. Perform this procedure for both the hot and cold faucets.
6. Turn off Demand Water pump and remove the hose and re-connect the domestic water demand pump’s suction line to the fresh water storage tank.""

The only mention of compressed air is in the Warning box:

""An FDA approved “GRAS” rated winterization antifreeze must be used. YOU CANNOT BLOW DOMESTIC WATER COIL OUT WITH AIR TO WINTERIZE AQUA-HOT."" In other words, using compressed air is neither necessary nor sufficient. ",Winterizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Aquahot manual is for the Aquahot...not for the washer / dryer and all other connections in the water system (hot AND cold).
Yes, using just antifreeze will likely work fine as it does displace the water. More thorough is to remove all ""easy to move"" water with air and THEN use antifreeze. Takes less antifreeze too as it's easier to know all hoses are filled with antifreeze when the flow transitions from Air to Antifreeze than it is from Water to Antifreeze.

But, the key part that many people mess up is you HAVE to use antifreeze as air alone won't move the water in the multiple coils in the Aquahot.

"I face this decision every year because we usually camp trackside at the Formula 1 race down in Austin, Texas in late October. It often gets cold enough to winterize here in Colorado before the trip, forcing me to winterize, then de-winterize for the trip, then winterize again. It’s no big deal. This year, it has been warm enough in Colorado that I didn’t have to do it before leaving for Austin next week.",Winterizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As an option, Steven & April, consider just draining all lines and leaving faucets and drain valves open to allow for expansion of what little liquid remains (if it freezes). Drain black and gray tanks and toilet. You should have a drain plug on the water heater tank as well as drain valve for fresh water tank. Additionally, in your wet bay should be two 'low point' valves for the hot and cold lines that will dump anything left in the system. Repeat when you return from FL and then add anti-freeze for the rest of the season. Just an option to consider.",Winterizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have a 2015 Newmar Ventana LE 4381. We are on the road. Yesterday, we got shut out of our rig because of the failure of the Trimark door latch on the entry door. Fortunately we had our cell phones, but not much else. We called a locksmith to no avail, understandably, because, as we discovered soon enough, the door was not locked. Something else was amiss. The local Newmar dealer service tech was kind enough to take our call (it's a weekend, y'all - no one makes house calls, Newmar is closed and our extended warranty provider is a joke (another story for another thread)). The local service tech asked questions about our situation -- the door handle was very loose with no give to it at all -- and helped us to understand that the door latch pinion (for lack of a better term) that inserts into the door jamb had failed. Our only option was to enter the rig another way. With our model, he explained that the only viable manner of ingress was the driver's side window, which, of course, was locked. Folks, we worked on trying to unlock that window for four hours. Without a sophisticated means of trying to bust the lock on the driver's window, we ended up having to break the glass. We'll be driving East today with plastic over a window, making all of us Newmar owners proud, I'm sure. The short of the long is, CHECK YOUR DOOR LATCH FREQUENTLY to ensure the pinion hasn't loosened up or REPLACE IT. If you still have the OEM door latch, it's a bad situation waiting to happen. Google the issue and you'll find this is not new news. It's a TriMark issue that is RV brand neutral. Why there hasn't been a recall is a head scratcher, but I'm looking at potentially $2500 plus for a new window. ",Door Locks and Parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry to hear about your problems with the latch. I recently read about it elsewhere and that thread linked this aftermarket fix: https://www.latchfix.com/

I don’t know anything about the company, so I’m not endorsing it but it may be worth investigating.

Because a door latch is a safety issue, you should file a complaint with NHTSA. That’s how recalls get started. ",Door Locks and Parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Was the issue the deadbolt, or the actual latch? I have been temporarily locked out several times due the the deadbolt not retracting all the way. Several methods work, Had the best luck with slamming the deadbolt key while banging, I mean really hard, on the door in the latch area. I keep a little graphite on it now to keep it lubricated.


On another note, sometimes my electric lock on the latch fails. This is due to the contacts on the hinge edge of the door getting corroded or dirty. I just clean them with a little WD-40 and a rag (spray the WD-40 on the rag first) every now and then to keep them clean.


Sorry to hear about the cost of the window, that sounds ridiculously high for a double pain piece of glass. Wish you the best.

"The main issue with the Tri Mark lock sets is the cheap pot metal casting that's spring loaded for the door strike. There's a thinner area the spring goes around that eventually fails causing the latch to go into the strike due to the spring and loosing the ability to pull it back out via the handle.

I've replaced the lock 3 times on my 2006 Georgetown, once locked out and twice locked in. Locked in is easier to fix as the lock and trim around the door can be partially dismantled and the strike pushed / pulled back to open the door and fully remove the lock and remove the broken strike. Using the deadbolt to secure the door while traveling.

From the outside requires some ingenuity in getting a thin flat device into the strike area to push it back to unlock the door - nor fun at all an may end up marring the outside.

Leaving a window uocked to be able to get back in is the best option (lessons learned) to unlock the coach.

Tri Mark should be making the strike from cast steel or billet aluminum that can take the ""snap"" that occurs when the door is closed not using the handle to keep the strike pulled back and releasing it slowly to latch the door - another thing leaned to get more longevity in these cheaply made latches.",Door Locks and Parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We have had a couple of issues with the door locks also. We had a broken wire inside the handle that prevented the code from working. I also found that on the door contact point (small spring loaded contact point on where the door hinges together) can get dirty and cause it to not lock because it thinks the door is not shut correctly.

After being locked out one time, we got spare door keys for the trimark locks (2 different keys). We keep 1 set in each of our vehicles to ensure we will never be locked out again since we use the code to enter and never take the remotes or key rings. If you want a set of these keys, you have to contact Trimark. No locksmith I have found can get the blanks to make them.

"On our trip south for the winter, I exited our Class C to take the trash to the dumpster. When I returned, the latch had broken.

"I did exactly that almost five years ago. Newmars price for those cheap plastic guides that easily break is absurd. I started by making a couple prototypes out of aircraft grade aluminum by hand. No issues, so I then had my S.I.L. machine up a batch. No issues since.

As a side note, I asked Newmar about the latch and guide issues and, of course, they had never heard of that....bull. I offered them an international source for the aluminum ones that would cost less than a 1/3rd of what they sell the cheap plastic ones for (of course it would have to be a production sized run).

"On our 18 LA the baggage doors have been getting harder and harder to close and when one was really getting harder to close decided to look at it. What I found was by taking the cover off and tightening all the loose screws and lubricating the locking assembly they closed so much easier. No adjustment to the latch just tightening and lubricating. Used white grease and some T-9 for lub. Since most of the holes for the screws to hold the covers on were loose went and put some wooden tooth picks and glue in holes and let it dry over night before petting the covers back on. With this the screws were tight again. Takes a couple hours but no more NEWMAR SLAM to shut the outside baggage doors.

I never had side baggage doors until my current unit. I certainly can't say I'm very impressed with Newmar's design, adjustments, or latch choice. Overall I'd give them a ""D"" on quality baggage doors.

My first and best design enhancement was to make aluminum latch ""riser/close"" parts to replace the ""prone-to-break"" cheap plastic ones Newmar uses AND install them on all doors.

"Two of the ""alignment plate bin brackets"" used for baggage doors with electric locks broke and the Newmar Parts catalog had them listed for $48 (Newmar Part # is 020658A). I contacted a fellow IRV2 contributor, friend, and Ventana owner and asked if he could make these on his 3D printer. The 3D printed version was not strong enough but he realized plastic cutting boards are about the same thickness and decided to fabricate them out of some old cutting boards using a drill press and band saw. His design included improvements to the original by increasing the thickness in a crucial pressure point and trimming some material away so the cable release had more room to operate. As an aside, one of my cable release pieces was frayed, and I did buy those replacements from Newmar (about $2.37 each). I would recommend checking those periodically and having a few spares on hand in case you find any that need replacing.

I installed my replacements today, and they look like they are going to work just fine.
