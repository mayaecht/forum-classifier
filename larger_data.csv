Other,A few months ago we got our first MH after having TCs for the last 30+ years. It is a '93 Flair 26' long with 40k miles on it. I wanted a shorter MH to be able to go to most of the places we went with the TC.
Other,After looking at them all I decided on the Monroe RV shock and stabilizer. One thing that helped was a 30% discount plus free shipping. 
Other,All in a good day's work. I keep a Google Task List on my phone with everything I would either like to do or needs to be done. Only 74 items left to be completed 🙄. Good thing I enjoy working on this coach.
Other,Amazing what you can miss even spending 90 minutes going over a coach prior to signing papers and driving away!
Other,And maybe some sumo springs. Hmmmmm
Exterior,Any trouble replacing the topper? Getting ready to do about a 12 foot topper in a week or two I hope
Electrical,"As I am getting ready for our weekend trip I look at my load control panel and it has an odd message. It has the model, software version, and a message ""no communication"" on it. So I find the mfg, Precision Circuits on the web and give them a call. The fellow answers the phone and I tell him my problem. He says it sound like the data cable may have popped off. So I pull the panel by my breaker box and check. The data cable looks like a phone cord and I see it going into the box. It's hard to get to and I try reseating it. No change. Then I pull the monitor panel out in the front of the coach. I unplug the cable and plug it back in. Bingo! Back to working again. I think I might have accidentally unseated the cable at the breaker box a couple of weeks ago when I was pulling a coax cable. Everything worked for the rest of my trip, so I think it's fixed."
Other,"As we all know these beasts are worse than the kids or the DW and need lots of attention. Seems like it's always asking me to bring it home for the weekend to ""give"" it some tlc. So I replaced the flush valve on the thereford Aqua magic IV, replaced the Kwikee step controller, 3 12 volt house batteries, circuit board for the Atwood water heater and next is replacing the slide topper material. Still need to research a bit more before doing that 1. What have you don't lately?"
Plumbing and Water,"At this point I've replaced the radiator, water pump, belts, hoses, AC compressor, converted to R134a refrigerant, and the coach batteries. I'm also working on many small leaks, replacing the refrigerator cooling unit, and plan to replace the brake master cyl. and hydroboost unit, possibly the rear brakes, and at least four tires. The tires have lots of tread but are weather cracked. I will also replace the outer skylight over the shower and install a better shower enclosure. The awning will also need some attention where the sun has damaged it at the top by the roller. Of course all lubricants will be changed, the chassis greased, and the front end has been aligned. I also have a backup camera to install so we can watch the toad. After that I think it will be ready for our upcoming 8k mile summer trip."
Other,"But boy do we love our residential fridge, full size 30"" gas range and stacked washer/dryer!"
Other,"Dicor'd the roof (just days before a torrential rainstorm, I might add)."
Heating and Cooling,Did it without breaking a glass and the power adjustment and heat still worked when done. (-:
Exterior,Disassembled passenger side mirror on the phaeton. Needed due to broken post (head to arm connection). Replaced the entire frame inside. Reassembled.
Other,"Don't spill that drink. No ""abusing "" adult beverages!!!!!!!"
Heating and Cooling,"February we fixed a minor generator issue and a major Hydro Hot issue. Next week is oil change. June is new tires on the steers, new shocks, alignment and brake check. MIGHT install a Safe-T-Plus."
Electrical,Fixed faulty turn signal assembly in steering column.
Electrical,"Front shocks, steering stabilizer damper. repair shower door, re-caulk roof, Install bumper slinky holder, grease, replace vacuum rubber connectors, Install ARP control on refer. getting ready fro first trip in May."
Chassis,"Got temp plates on Friday, passed emissions on Friday as well with flying colors. Full clean and detail is ongoing. Rear, front and one side done with the buffer. Buffer is evil i might add. Next Saturday the girl will have new shoes on the rear. Oil and filter changed. Chassis lubed. All good so far."
Chassis,"Had the airbags replaced (after 20yrs I figured it was time) then did a chassis lube, installed crossfires, added tpms system, flushed and bleached the freshwater system. Next weekend I'll do the filters and we'll be ready for the first trip of the year."
Chassis,"Hmm, two new chassis batteries, new service on Aqua Hot, removed, threw away Roadmaster Invisibrake, , installed new state of the Art SMI Air Force One supplemental braking system. Enough already"
Other,Hmmm... let's see. Lately?
Electrical,I changed the battery in my satellite remote control. 
Electrical,"I just had the tran service done, and cleaned the coach. Now all thats left is 4 new 6v batteries for the house and we are ready."
Other,"I know , I know.. not a class A anymore.... dang I hate having nothing to fix..."
Other,I sure wish someone else had maintained it a little better.:-))
Other,"I'm not sure if it will ever end. I started out with an entry level rig, if I keep going I may end up with a high end coach 🚍!"
Other,"I'm watching this. If I spill my cocktail, I'll have to clean it up."
Electrical,Installed a new slide out motor on the Galley slide. Almost thought I'd bit of more than I could chew but all's good.
Other,Is it ever enough?
Other,Isn't that enough?
Winterizing,"It took all winter but I had to replace throttle link and return springs. Road test between places we stayed and adjust as needed. FL,MS,TX and finally got it right in NM. In AZ now and all is good. "
Electrical,"It's always something with these toys. I had the banks power pack exhaust and headers installed since the MH had broken bolts in the exhaust manifold. BTW, the Banks is not cheap but best money I ever spent...it's like driving a New motorhome! Installed Koni shocks, also money well spent. Tuned it up with new plugs, wires, distributor cap, coil, pvc. 4 New Michelins on the drive axle. New kitchen faucet, upgraded power converter to progressive dynamics unit, and am trying to see why the bedroom reading lamps don't work. Oh, also removed the fuel tank and cleaned it out and had a shop re-weld the seams due to a leak. That was a pain, especially since it had about 45 gallons of fuel in it and an anti syphon device so couldn't syphon it out. Later I will need to address a leak in one of the rear hydraulic jacks but this is enough for now. Even with my belly aching....I love this MH and I actually enjoy tinkering with it."
Other,It's been a busy 2016 so far 
Other,I've started looking into replacing shocks and airbags. Also looking into steering stabilizers and track bars. Undecided at this point but research is everything

Other,Just starting the re roof project on the Dutch Star. Lots of learning.
Electrical,"JUST TEASING, my floor creaks in one spot like crazy though, and my ""single stage"" charger will COOK my batteries if I leave it on too long.... "
Heating and Cooling,Leant the moho out this weekend and my boss said the fridge wasn't cooling properly. Looks like I'll be diving into that this weekend
Other,Lol. Priorities are a must. I must add the only reason I was able to do any of these things is because of the info and help I received on this forum. Always start here and then watch you tube videos until I feel confident
Exterior,Missed two things on our PDI on our new rig. A broken toilet bolt and a cracked upper awning bracket. Have had them both fixed for little to no money.
Other,My wife found a mat that fits our bathroom floor perfectly.  stoked about that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chassis,Need to replace trombetta solenoid for slides and leveling system! Replaced awning topper on living room slide! Replaced chassis battery's on way home from Florida!

Wiper Parts,"Realigned wiper arm, parked too low on the windshield. It's in the shop now to replace the GY 670's wi Michelin's - to finally fix the vibration (I hope), safe-t-steer going on as well. Already added Centrumatics. 5-star tune added last week - I popped a wheelie! <just kidding>. Shifts feel much more positive and it really settled down on cruise control on the limited test drive I took. Installed dash clips that were left off from the factory and I discovered while wiring the TPMS to get power - Thor sent me some clips. Installed an oxygenics shower head, screen door grab bar, and a sound bar on the lounge TV."
Other,Replaced both bathroom sink faucets.
Other,Replaced fuel shutdown solenoid on the Onan. 
Other,Replaced kitchen sink faucet.
Exterior,"Replaced the sky light, twice--being anal it wasn't as good as it should have been (how is it a perfectly square sky light that fits over a perfectly square hole in the roof can't be screwed down any way you put it--seems the pre-drilled screw holes have a reason). Took out the toilet and completely replaced all the parts and put it back and the sprayer didn't work (seems you have to cut a nipple off the fitting if you use a sprayer). Took my coach to a dealer for step recall, ac service and replace ac roof seals. On the way a friend caliper locked burnt out ABS. Had the coach a week due to parts screw ups. Back home, waiting on the ABS sensor but brake job done to front end (new rotors, calipers, pads) now the front ac not working. They put ac down on wiring loom and it arc'd in the connection from thermostat to ac. Back one works great, front one not getting ac power. Paid a local guy for 3 hrs to trouble shoot--he replaced the little connector for the thermostat wire and ac but that didn't correct problem. Dealer will have to do. Oh, I just had knee surgery last Friday--a month after foot surgery opposite foot. I need a little good juju to come my way!"

Other,"Slide toppers: Call Chris at StoneVos in Brooksville, FL Excellent!!"
Chassis,"So far in 2016 I have added 300 watts of solar, oil change on genset and engine, added balance rings, cleaned up some 'fixes' from the previous owner, lubed the chassis, fixed the screens the kids broke, fixed the kids bedroom door they broke, I'm sure there are other things and the kids will break something else with the first use in a couple of weeks. Almost seems like a full time job with the up keep and the kids."
Other,Thanks for the link brother!!!!!
Other,that's pretty darn sweet looking! 
Other,They have to be better then the leaky one that was on it.
Other,Trying to decide on a trac bar - getting a little push on the highway with trucks passing or stiff breezes...and maybe sumo springs.
Heating and Cooling,"Ugh, not what I've done. What I need to do. Replace air filter, drain and flush coolant for MH and generator, change cartridge on air dryer, change transmission filters and wash and wax. Did I say ugh? 😕"
Other,Washed and waxed.
Other,"Well..I ""had fixed"" the exhaust manifold, the exhaust-brake tube, a serious fuel leak and the toad brake pump all in one gulp at the shop. Remaining is the drippy water drain discovered at the shop and the dead dash air."
Other,"What have you fixed, repaired or maintained lately"""
Other,"When we get back, if we still like it, I will probably replace the rubber roof along with a few other things. At that point we will probably keep it for many years."
Other,"^^^^^ Nice. Wife was up there and said the fins were looking bad. I even went to Harbor Freight, but forgot to grab the radiator comb. Congrats."
Other,70 psig difference.
Other,A good RV tech should get at least 40 - 45 an hour. Perhaps a family discount of 10% is in order. LOL.
Other,Also I am trying to find/fix a nasty oil leak (not fun)
Heating and Cooling,and did all the filters and fluid changes
Other,And much easier on the system.
Other,And then there is thoughs that don't fix a thing and want a premium price when selling...

Hardware,Hinged the cabinet cover for inside access to water heater (had been screwed on by factory).
Other,Hmm. Does it count as doing something if you can't get it done ? DH called Frigidare for service on fridge in 2016 Forest River Berkshire. Frigidare cannot dispatch service because the item is not where you registered it from!! They did offer to sell us an extended warranty!? Our first trip since purchase last Sept & waiting for the real fun to begin . Lol

Other,I need to replace mine and keep the old one as a spare. Or buy a new one and just have it ready to swap I guess
Heating and Cooling,"I replaced the oil cooler gaskets and seals on my CAT 3126. If you're looking to do something that requires folding your arms and body in ways that aren't humanly possible, I suggest trying it."
Interior,I think that my coach originally had a combo co2/smoke detector that was hardwired into the 12v. I now have a battery powered seperate smoke detector and co2 detectors mounted in seperate locations. Not sure why but this is how it was when we bought it.
Other,I would love to see pics of the finished product. I have a 97 Pace

Replace A/C gaskets. Recoat EPDM roof and caulk everywhere (roof and body) Install fan in refer to even out cooling or possibly replace temperature controller. Cools too well with fridge at 20 degrees and freezer at 0. Recharge dash ac. Fix a couple of light switches inside. Install an inverter as this coach never had one from the factory.

Other,Replaced three out of four rear tires.... Two along side of the road in West Texas when the outside duelly blew(when I looked at the inside.. I told the road service guys too bring two) and one at Les Schwab in Denver as a precaution because it was just as old as the two I'd just replaced on the road.

Other,Then I will return the Flounder so the daughter can build her nest inside before vacation.
Other,This equals no more trips on High Head Pressure
Chassis,"This past week I lubed the chassis and adjusted the ride height. Made ramps like what a poster suggested, 2x12 built up for 6"" rise. Mine are 4' long and the 6 nicely support the coach with the extra height that I can slide around under the coach on a creeper even with the air suspension dumped. I checked to make sure before I started on the suspension. Last week added the TPMS."
Other,"This week--installed Autoformer, replaced the coalescing filter on top of engine, ran wires from batt to wetbay for portable macerator."

This part will do the trick!""- tons of new parts later and we have a working generator & a huge dent in our trip funds!"
Lights,"We now need to find out why a ""utilities"" toggle switch stays lit all the time ( that is a new thing) & why our top left side running light won't cone on. Fun time!"
Other,Well we bought our coach in November and just finished our 2500 mile maiden voyage a couple of weeks ago.
