Exterior,Electric awning arm pulled out,"During a return from AZ got caught in a blizzard, while washing the MH today I noticed the arm that attaches to the coach had pulled away from the fiberglass leaving three 1/4 inch holes in the fiberglass any ideas how to reattach the arm, what could I use to fill the holes strong enough to reattach the screws and expanding rivets that where factory installed ",Negative
Electrical,Battery issues on my D Pusher,"Any other reason other than a run down chassis batterys (2) would make the coach turn over very slowly while attempting to start? Cant get it to start?

Chassis,Hydraulic Jacks,"Hi all. My Tiffin gas unit is up on its levellers and they won’t retract. Plenty of fluid, the parking brake is on, no blown fuses or breaker that I can find, the lights on the dash controller are on, as is the very annoying alarm that sounds continually when jacks are down and the ignition is on. Pressing any of the four up or down arrows though, results in nothing.
Would anyone have any thoughts? ",Negative
Electrical,"Major screw up on my slide out, please help!","I finished replacing carpet with vinyl plank floor and need to add more seat belt to the passenger side sofa, while wait for the seat belt, I forgot to tighten one bolt (from slide bottom to the floor to secure the sofa) , when I finally ready to do the seat belt, I extended the slide, but that bolt dropped half way and broke and twisted a piece a aluminum and seal, it also pulled a piece of plywood out (please see attached)

I guess the first thing I have to do is jack up the slide(no sure how much to jack it up) and take the aluminum piece out and put the plywood back. that carpet is the area I can't reach, I will just yank it out.

I will probably remove the floor in order to put the plywood back.

No sure if aluminum piece is salvageable ,as it broke on the right side I will have to replace that aluminum, it will probably has to be custom made??

I don't believe the aluminum is structure as it is not very thick.

The challenge is how to remove it as it is right under the slide now( i believe it is not attached to the slide, it maybe attached to the wall) and put it new one back ( assuming I can order a new one) .

Only a portion of the aluminum is twisted (3'-4'), so I maybe able to only cut the and replace the twisted piece.

No sure how the piece is secured to the frame.

Need to jack up the slide tomorrow at least one inch to figure all this out.


Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated!",Negative
Wiper Parts,2001 Winnebago Journey 32T windshield wiper,"I'm having a problem with my wipers not returning to home position when I turn them off or use ""intermittent"". It seems there are 3 different places it likes to stop, one is straight up, another is 2 o'clock, and the last is ""home"" position.
I have removed the motor and connected 12v to it. It works just fine, so I'm thinking there must be a control module somewhere. It's not under the front compartment with the wiper motor. I can trace the wiring to where it goes through the firewall. I have removed the cover over the dash gauges and it's not in there. I then got down on the floor and looked up under the steering wheel area. What a big mess of wiring there is. It's all strapped together, so before I attempt to cut straps and try to move it all out of the way, I thought I might be enlightened by someone who may have had some experience with it.
I can put up with it by turning the wipers off by waiting for that certain position, but I just like things to work the way they're supposed to.
Sure would appreciate any suggestions. If I just get a couple ""live with it"" comments, then I will do just that. Thanks, Gene in Idaho. ",Negative
Heating and Cooling,Heat pump blowing cold air,We have an 04 holiday rambler with two ac units with heat pumps. A month ago they both worked when heat pumps were on(outside temps in high 40’s.

Plumbing and Water,Winnebago Shurflow water pump replacement,"I have a 2014 Winnebago Journey 36M. It appears the water pump has failed. It is model 4008-101-F65. It has power, is warm to the touch and produces no pressure with city water shut off and a tap open. My question is: Does anyone see a way to get this pump out without cutting all the compression clamp hoses? I was thinking about the 8 screws on the face might allow me to disconnect the pump but leave all the lines. It seems that to unscrew the white couplings I would need 1/2 play on each side to get it out. Any help is greatly appreciated. ",Negative

Winterizing,Class A winterizing question,"HI,

A buddy passed away a couple of months ago. I am helping his wife put their RV down for the winter. I am on my 4th travel trailer so I am familiar with winterizing.

They have a 2000 Four Winds Hurricane 34K. To start I cannot find the low water drains under the camper. I am also a bit confused on how to properly winterize this thing. I have posted a couple of pics of the hatch next to the water fill ports on the outside and a pic inside the hatch of what appears to be the water pump and I am not sure what the vertical white hose with the cap is.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks",Negative
Plumbing and Water,Black tank flush hack,"I wanted to use hot water to flush my BWT at home with no hook-up. The tank was ""empty"" but you never know what lurks in there. I have a hot water hose spigot so I hooked the hose up to the tank flush connection on my 2018 Newmar Baystar but I wanted to avoid using the slinky to drain the flush.

The hack: the Iworx leaf blower nozzle exactly fits into the slinky drain connection and it will extend into a 5 gal bucket which is carried into the downstairs toilet and flushed. (best done while DW is at the store). I imagine most leaf blower nozzles are about the same......mine friction fits into the drain fitting......see pics below. ",Positive
Interior,No power to Dash AC/Window Fans/Radio,"Hello friends,

I have an electrical puzzle that has be stumped:

When I turn the ignition switch (or don't) I cannot get the dash AC, the cute window fans, or the radio to power on.

When I enable the chassis power switch, the radio will power on.

Dash AC and Window fans continue to not power on regardless of chassis power switch state.

I probed the ignition power wire leading to the stereo and confirms it only gets 12 volts when the chassis power switch is enabled. It will then supply 12v regardless of the ignition switch state.

When I probe the Accessory fuse, it will interact with the key state and will supply 12v when the key is turned to 'on' and 'accessory' positions.

There is the ignition electrical control box mounted on the bottom of the steering column, but since that is interacting with the accessory fuse I ruled it out.

Things I have recently done:

    Replaced house and starter (chassis) batteries.
    Replaced positive terminal ends on the starter battery (it was falling apart)
    Installed a new stereo (this is working fine when the coach power switch is enabled)
    Checked all fuses under the dashboard.
    I have rechecked my work to no avail but cannot find any issues there, but totally open ideas.


House batteries are disabled using an inline switch, hopefully isolating house electrical from being a variable here.

Feels like this is further up the chain in the wiring, but from what I can tell its just wire harnesses and they all appear to be plugged in.

Need someone smarter than me to tell me I'm an idiot and tell me what I am overlooking",Negative

Door Locks and Parts,TriMark Lock Does It Again,"The third TriMark lockset for our motorhome failed and like an idiot I made the mistake of contacting TriMark for a replacement. I will never make that mistake again. After a discussion on the phone with Abby Lichtenberg about the replacement needed I identified the lock I needed from two photos sent to me. When the lock arrived it was not the one I ask for. Abby was upset that I might question her decision to send me the wrong lock but finally agreed to sent the proper one with a discussion to return the incorrect one once the replacement arrived, to which I agreed. You can image my surprise when a charge showed up on my credit card for the replacement lock before it even arrived. The replacement arrived and I packaged up the incorrect lock and returned it immediately and send the tracking number to Abby. I received a notice that the lock was delivered to TriMark and I sent an email off about the second charge. I was told I was getting a refund for $10.00 less that I was charged. First I was told that it was because I did not return a gasket. The gasket was not sent with the second lock even though it should have been. Then I was told there is a difference between the price of the original incorrect lock and the replacement. This is the absolutely poorest customer service I have ever received. I am posting this as a caution to anyone that might find themselves dealing with TriMark in the future so you might know what to expect. Should this lock fail again in the future, and there is a good chance it will, I will remove and replace the door if need be to not have to use a TriMark product. Never again. Poor quality product, even poorer customer support. Chuck ",Negative
