Class A Motorhomes,Slide - electrical issue,"Boy I hope someone can help us. We were traveling home and stopped at a very nice harvest host. They had 50 amp service which we hooked up to, put the slides out and chilled for the night. About 7:00 the next morning we are readying to leave and the slides won't come in. I had been worried that this might happen as it did the morning before after a night of boondocking at a different harvest host. I got the slides to come in that time by switching the inverter (Tripp lite) (1250 I think) from auto (to power the frig while traveling) to dc charge only. Did that a few times and eventually they went in. This time the slide the switch trick didn't work. Tried running the engine (key is supposed to be in on position), running the generator, staying hooked to shore power, unhooked from shore power, Clicking my heels and spinning around 3 times, and cursing like a a drunken sailor. Couldn't create the magic. 6 hours later we got a mobile rv tech to come out. He tried a bunch of things and nothing appeared to be working. He switched the inverter switch to dc charge for about 5 minutes and then back to auto, and they came in. Based on this he said he believes my batteries are bad. Traveled home without chancing the slide outs after that. Upon getting home I checked the batteries and found they were all low on water and were 3.5 years old. I added water and tried to charge them. I could operate the slides but very few of the cells would register as good on the hydrometer. Keep trying to charge for a few days and never could bring them up full charge 13.6 on my screen typical when all is well. So I figured my poor maintenance killed them. I installed 4 new 6v batteries and the slides worked. I let them charge up and when I checked after a couple of days my gauge on the wall showed 13.6v. A few days went by and now the slides again will not go out. Messed with the inverter switch again and could not get them to go. I noticed the wall gauge voltage dropping like a rock when I removed the 50 amp it is plugged into. Sorry for the long explanation. Although I am fairly handy I am not very savvy with electrical systems/issues. I have a volt meter but I'm not super familiar with how to use it. Any ideas on a culprit or if the consensus is the inverter, is it difficult to change out? I have a diagnostic appt next Tuesday at camping world, but I loathe paying their rates. TIA"
Class A Motorhomes,Clean/treat fiberglass roof,I have a 2004 Dutchstar with a fiberglass roof. My previous rig had a rubber roof so I'm not sure what the correct way to clean and/or treat the fiberglass.
Class A Motorhomes,Parking brake alert keeps going off randomly,I have a 2013 Winnebago Vista with a Ford V-10. My parking brake alert has started randomly beeping and lighting up the dash while I'm going down the road. Not sure if it is a sensor issue or something more.
Class A Motorhomes,Trouble with velcro,Adding the light weight silver heat reflective material to the inside of the windshield and two front side windows. Intent is to reflect the heat back to help cool the coach in hot sunny weather. Cut out the sections (3) and put up velcro on the outside of the reflective material (Reflectix BP48010 Double Pack Insulation) and along the edges of the windshield and side windows. Some velcro at the top and then velcro all the way down the sides. Worked fine. It was surprising how much cooler it was and the AC even shut off and on when in the past they ran constantly in that kind of weather.
Class A Motorhomes,Hydraulic Jacks,"Hi all. My Tiffin gas unit is up on its levellers and they won't retract. Plenty of fluid, the parking brake is on, no blown fuses or breaker that I can find, the lights on the dash controller are on, as is the very annoying alarm that sounds continually when jacks are down and the ignition is on. Pressing any of the four up or down arrows though, results in nothing. Would anyone have any thoughts?"

I have a problem on my 98 Newmar Dutch Star freightliner chassis where while I am driving, the cruise control disengages and i have to hit resume to get it to come back. Sometimes it takes a while before it happens and after it happens the frequency of disengaging gets more and more frequent. Any suggestions on what to look for? Appreciate any help you can provide."
